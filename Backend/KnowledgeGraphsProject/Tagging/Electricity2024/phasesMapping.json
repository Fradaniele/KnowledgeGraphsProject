generally costly.", "207": "For example, reopening an aluminium smelter can cost up to EUR 400 million .", "208": "Hence, it is likely some of the temporary shutdowns to date will be followed by permanent closures.", "209": "The chemical industry has been severely affected from elevated energy costs, with the risks of permanent closures compounded by reduced competitiveness as China dominates growth.", "210": "Producers such as Yara, Dow, INEOS, Grupa Azoty, among many others, curtailed production of chemical products such as polyethylene, ammonia, urea, nitrates and NPK  fertilisers.",

their emissions by 5%.", "214": "Assuming a similar 5% reduction in energy consumption, this amounts to 0,3 TWh of permanent electricity demand reductions.", "215": "The European primary metal industry was hit especially hard by soaring electricity prices due to the energy intensive nature of the production process.", "216": "For primary aluminium, for example, electricity costs generally make up about 40% of the cost of production.", "217": "Considering the ongoing curtailments and announced shutdowns until end of 2023, our analysis shows the loss in EU annual electricity demand,

each.", "233": "These reductions in zinc production correspond to an estimated yearly electricity demand loss of almost 4 TWh.", "234": "Shutdowns and production reductions in silicon and silicon based alloys from the plants of Ferroglobe in Spain and France are estimated to similarly account for a loss of annual electricity demand of almost 2 TWh.", "235": "The steel sector lost almost 4 Mt

elevated energy costs, flexible operation is becoming increasingly more important for energy intensive industries.", "237": "ArcelorMittal reacted to the rise in electricity costs by taking advantage of the flexibility of their system stopping during an electricity price peak and resuming after the peak had passed.", "238": "Other producers such as Salzgitter chose to continue operations at its steel plant in Peine using the flexibility of their facilities to shift production to lower cost hours, thereby partially mitigating the adverse effects of the increased energy costs.", "239": "Many large energy intensive industries across the European Union are often exempted from various taxes and fees related to electricity and are also partially compensated for the indirect costs resulting from the EU Emissions Trading System .", "240": "By contrast, small and medium sized industries generally face higher electricity prices.", "241": "A survey in Germany showed that during the peak of

industrial businesses declaring bankruptcy increased at an even higher rate of 10% over the same period.", "244": "High energy costs for small and medium sized companies are particularly problematic if they are also facing international competition, as relatively higher EU energy costs decrease their competitiveness.", "245": "A survey conducted in 2023 by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce found that one third of the country\u2019s companies that were considering investing abroad cited concerns about high energy cost as a disadvantage.", "246": "For example, the manufacturer of

concerns over high energy cost in the future.", "248": "Outside the energy intensive sectors, some smaller businesses were also strongly hit by soaring energy bills, often without the financial buffer that large companies tend to have.", "249": "Particularly affected, for example, are bakeries, where businesses scrambled to adjust operations for energy saving or decided to file for insolvency under the pressure of rising electricity prices", "250": ".", "251": "Many countries, such as France, Germany, Poland and Spain, introduced measures to dampen the negative effect on local businesses.",

other sectors are more dependent on cheap energy inputs.", "255": "Our analysis shows that chemicals, steel, and aluminium are more exposed to increasing energy cost.", "256": "Despite energy prices stabilising in 2023, the metal and chemical industries remain vulnerable, with margins expected to stay at low levels until 2025.", "257": "While other industries may have a more positive outlook, increasing uncertainty and expectations about future price increases may still negatively impact business conditions for industry in Europe.", "258": "The issue of reduced production of energy intensive goods in the European Union amid high energy prices has contributed to an increase in imports in these sectors, which was particularly observable in 2022.", "259": "This raises the question of how much electricity is not consumed in the European Union but is shifted to other regions and imported from there indirectly in the form of energy intensive goods.", "260": "Our analysis shows that over 160 TWh of electricity , corresponding to 6% of EU electricity demand , was indirectly imported in 2022 into the European Union in the form of energy intensive goods made up by chemicals, primary aluminium, crude steel, paper pulp, and cement.", "261": "After an estimated 8% year on year increase in 2022, 2023 is expected to record a decline of 4% in indirect imports of electricity in the form of the energy intensive goods, which can be attributed to the slowdown in EU manufacturing, weaker demand and overhang of inventories.", "262": "Nevertheless, 2023 imports are still estimated to be 4% higher than the 2021 levels.", "263": "This means that, in the years 2022 and 2023 combined, an additional 18 TWh of electricity was imported compared to 2021 levels in the form of energy intensive goods considered in our analysis, mostly due to higher primary aluminium imports.", "264": "The largest cumulative increases in energy intensive imports since 2021 have been in primary aluminium.", "265": "In 2022 and 2023 combined, there was an additional 20 TWh of indirect electricity imports, compared to 2021 levels.", "266": "Around half of this came from higher imports from India, which was followed by United Arab Emirates.", "267": "Chemicals was another sector which saw growth in imports in 2022, with about 2 TWh more indirect electricity imported compared to 2021, mainly from the United States and China.", "268": "But the imports of chemicals declined in 2023 amid slower economic activity, more than offsetting this increase.", "269": "Pulp and cement imports similarly saw increases in 2022, but were more than offset by significant declines in 2023.", "270": "There have been also changes with respect to where these energy intensive products came from.", "271": "For example, in order to substitute the loss of crude steel imports from Ukraine following the Russian invasion, imports from China, Brazil, India, and other countries increased in 2022.", "272": "Sanction hit Russia has seen a sharp drop in exports to the European Union in the energy intensive industries.", "273": "The share of Russia in the indirect electricity imports from these energy intensive goods is estimated to have decreased from 18% in 2019 and 14% in 2021, to 9% in 2023.", "274": "As sanctions entered into force gradually over the course of 2023, Russia was still one of the largest sources of indirect electricity imports to the European Union in the form of energy intensive goods in 2023, largely due to substantial amounts of steel imports, followed by primary aluminium and chemicals.", "275": "Russia\u2019s share in the imports of these energy intensive goods is expected to decrease further in the future, as sanctions are rigorously applied.", "276": "However, other products such as primary aluminium are currently not sanctioned.", "277": "Even though there are sanctions on individual aluminium products, primary aluminium remains unsanctioned since it is considered a strategic raw material by the European Union.", "278": "Additionally, Russian aluminium is still strongly integrated within European supply chains.", "279": "However, there have been calls within Europe\u2019s aluminium industry group to lobby for EU sanctions on Russian aluminium.", "280": "Next to overall competitiveness influenced by energy prices, EU carbon policy will additionally play a large role in determining the future of the energy intensive industries in Europe.", "281": "Relying to a large extent on price based policies, the EU ETS will soon be accompanied by a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism  at the centre of its climate policy.", "282": "Allowance prices have been rising over the last few years, exceeding EUR 100/t CO2 in February 2023 for the first time, before falling and averaging about EUR 85/t CO2 in the second half of the year.", "283": "In addition, progressing decarbonisation will ease the burden accordingly as companies invest in reducing the carbon intensity of production.", "284": "Other countries outside the European Union have significantly lower carbon prices and/or rely on subsidy based programmes , or have no effective policies targeting CO2 emissions.", "285": "Additionally, the European Union uses a range of measures to counter potential negative effects on the competitiveness and carbon leakage of industry.", "286": "After providing free allowances to energy intensive industries in the first years of the EU ETS, the CBAM will be phased in, pricing embedded carbon on EU imports for key sectors, including cement, aluminium, steel and fertilisers.", "287": "This can aid competitiveness in the domestic market and shield against import pressure.", "288": "However, EU firms largely relying on exports will still need to compete in international markets, where other firms might face less stringent carbon pricing policies.", "289": "Partially addressing this, electricity compensation schemes allow member states to provide state aid for a limited time up until 2030, to offset increases in electricity cost associated with the EU ETS  We estimate that data centres, cryptocurrencies, and
