remainder is offset by direct air capture, negative emissions from bioenergy or other forms of carbon removal.", "18": "Historically, the expansion of gross domestic product growth has been faster than the rate of energy demand growth, reflecting improvements in the energy intensity of GDP.", "19": "These improvements in energy intensity continue and even accelerate in our scenarios: global GDP continues to expand, but it takes steadily less energy to fuel this growth .", "20": "Electric technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles deliver energy services more efficiently than those

more electrified and renewables rich energy system, highlighting the need for policy makers to continually adjust and assess their approach to energy security.", "62": "One issue of particular concern for many policy makers today is the concentration in a small number of countries of clean energy supply chains for manufacturing capacity and critical mineral mining and processing.", "63": "China has a very large proportion of existing manufacturing capacity for key clean energy technologies.", "64": "This includes 85 95% of global manufacturing capacity for battery cathode and anode materials,

looking to bolster domestic clean energy manufacturing.", "66": "Both the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act include major incentives for domestic manufacturing, and around 10% of the USD 2 trillion clean energy investment earmarked by governments around the world since 2020 comes with conditions that require local content.", "67": "Some countries are also taking steps

meet the 2030 domestic deployment needs associated with their climate goals, provided that all planned projects come online as scheduled.", "70": "In many other clean energy supply chains, however, a large portion of planned projects are being developed in precisely the regions where most capacity is already located .", "71": "For example, some 50 95% of supply growth between 2023 and 2035 for refined copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt is projected to take place in today\u2019s largest producer, such as China or Indonesia.", "72": "Another concern is the level of critical mineral supplies that are available.", "73": "For a number of critical minerals, supply growth from the pipeline of confirmed and announced projects is set to be slower than expected growth in demand.", "74": "The situation is most pressing for copper and lithium, highlighting some new risks to supply security and clean energy transitions.", "75": "Market signals should lead to the development of new projects, although new mining projects tend to have very long lead times.", "76": "On the demand side, changes in battery chemistries or enhanced efforts for recycling may succeed in reducing demand.", "77": "Policy makers need to be alert to the new energy security risks that are emerging in clean energy and look for ways to mitigate them.", "78": "However, there are some important differences between the risks for consumers associated with clean energy and those that arise from traditional fuels.", "79": "With traditional fuels, a shortage in supply means that consumers immediately face higher prices to continue operating existing equipment such as cars and boilers.", "80": "With clean energy, a shortage in supplies would tend to increase the cost of new equipment but would have little immediate effect on the cost of using existing equipment.", "81": "Electric vehicles provide the main mechanism to decarbonise the road transport sector.", "82": "Their prospects in recent years have been bolstered by ambitious plans from governments and the EV and battery industries .", "83": "However, the transition to mass market adoption is unlikely to be linear, and additional efforts are

first half of 2024.", "87": "Even if China is set to one side, however, the overall percentage rise in sales elsewhere in the global market is over 10%.", "88": "While sales in the European Union remained flat, with a decline in Germany offsetting a rise elsewhere of around 3% on average, the United Kingdom saw a 15% rise, and the United States recorded an increase of nearly 10%.", "89": "Large jumps in year on year sales also occurred in nascent EV markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, the Caspian region and the Middle East.", "90": "One important trend is the rising share of plug in hybrid electric vehicle sales, which accounted for over 35% of total EV sales in the first half of 2024.", "91": "In China, the PHEV sales increase was largely driven by range extended electric vehicles which have longer driving ranges due to larger batteries.", "92": "This provides an average electric range of around 130 kilometres , compared with 80 km for a standard PHEV .", "93": "Sales of PHEVs, including REEVs, surged by 70% in China, while sales of battery electric vehicles rose by only 15%.", "94": "Similarly, in the United States PHEV sales increased by 25%, compared to just 5% for BEVs.", "95": "This highlights the need for an expansion of recharging infrastructure to ease range anxiety.", "96": "EV sales are anticipated to be robust over the rest of 2024, with around 17 million electric cars being sold over the course of the year.", "97": "China is expected to continue dominating global growth, with electric car sales topping over 10 million during 2024.", "98": "It is worth noting in this context that the EV market in China has maintained strong momentum through August, with monthly sales exceeding 1 million units .", "99": "The continuing rise in EV sales is well above what was predicted by some analysts in 2022 when battery costs increased by 7%.", "100": "In fact, this increase prompted the battery industry to adopt different chemistries that require less cobalt and nickel, and this \u2013 together with further developments in battery technology \u2013 has led battery cell prices to drop below USD 80 per kilowatt hour during the first nine months of 2024.", "101": "Challenges and uncertainties are inevitable, but there are strong underlying reasons why EV sales are likely to continue to expand rapidly.", "102": "One of the most important is that battery prices are continuing to fall, prompting automakers to reduce EV sticker prices.", "103": "Key automakers in the United States have reduced the price of their main models by more than USD 10 000, for example .", "104": "Chinese automakers have also made price reductions of around USD 1 600 compared to 2022 .", "105": "European automakers are meanwhile planning to launch seven new models in 2025 priced at under USD 28 000 .", "106": "While some automakers have adjusted their short term targets and made slight changes to their longer term 2030 projections, their commitment to EVs remains robust across the board.", "107": "The same is true for the battery industry globally, which is currently experiencing consolidation rather than a reduction in plans.", "108": "Although some incentive schemes have been revised, governments remain active in supporting EV uptake in a variety of ways .", "109": "China recently launched a new tradein policy to encourage drivers to scrap less efficient vehicles and replace them with either electric or more efficient ones, and is looking at ways to speed development of charging infrastructure.", "110": "In the European Union, stringent CO2 standards are prompting automakers to expand EV production.", "111": "The United States aims to increase EV uptake by providing subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act and to support the development of charging infrastructure under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.", "112": "But there is much still to do, and delays in the roll out of charging infrastructure or in policy implementation could lead to the market share of electric cars in 2030 being about ten percentage points lower than projected in the STEPS, though this would still mean a big increase in EV shares from current levels .", "113": "In energy terms, the adoption of EVs means a shift from a fossil fuel based mobility system to one that relies much more on critical minerals, and a linking of the transport and power sectors.", "114": "There are clear synergies between manufacturing batteries for EVs and for energy storage, and processes from one industry can benefit the other.", "115": "For example, EV batteries could be repurposed for storage applications.", "116": "They could also support grid flexibility through smart charging, helping to optimise grid load, and through bi directional charging, supplying power to buildings or the grid .", "117": "In the STEPS, electricity demand from EVs rises from 115 TWh today to around 1 000 TWh by 2030 \u2013 an amount equivalent to today\u2019s electricity demand in Japan.", "118": "This increase accounts for around 15% of total global electricity demand growth.", "119": "Significant as this is, the impact of EVs on the oil market is even more significant .", "120": "Over the past decade, road transport has increased oil demand by 4,2 mb/d, accounting for more than 45% of global oil demand growth.", "121": "However, oil demand for passenger cars declines by 1 mb/d from today\u2019s levels by 2030, and this is largely responsible for global oil demand reaching a peak by the end of this decade in the STEPS.", "122": "With renewables providing an ever increasing share of power generation, electro mobility helps to drive the world towards its climate commitments, and EVs displace nearly 10 billion barrels of oil from 2020 to 2030, avoiding a total of over 4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the process.", "123": "In the STEPS, nearly one in two cars sold are electric by 2030.", "124": "In the NZE Scenario, electric cars account for over two thirds of sales by 2030.", "125": "Achieving this level requires further movement in a number of areas.", "126": "One of the most pressing is cost differentials.", "127": "Despite recent price reductions, on average an electric car is USD 10 000 15 000 more expensive than a comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, though this is much less of an issue in China, where over 60% of electric cars are priced below their conventional counterparts .", "128": "Another critical issue is the need for extensive charging infrastructure.", "129": "To achieve a two thirds market share of electric cars, investment of nearly USD 1000 billion will be required from now until 2030, which represents a 45% increase over levels in the STEPS.", "130": "A third issue is meeting the demand for batteries.", "131": "Annual EV battery demand reaches around 5,5 TWh by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, up from 0,8 TWh in 2023.", "132": "However, the battery industry seems well positioned to meet this escalating demand, with recent announcements and developments indicating a robust capacity to scale up production and develop technology.", "133": "The global energy economy is increasingly electrifying.", "134": "Since 2010, electricity demand has increased on average by 2,7% per year, while overall energy demand has risen by 1,4% per year.", "135": "Electricity is increasingly being used in place of fossil fuels to provide heat, mobility and industrial energy demand.", "136": "Innovations such as smart grids and advances in the efficiency of electric motors and appliances have also boosted the appeal of electricity.", "137": "The share of electricity in total final consumption rises more rapidly than in the past in all three scenarios and across nearly all regions.", "138": "This trend is a consequence of increased electrification in households and commercial buildings as well as in transport and industry.", "139": "Most of this demand growth is from emerging market and developing economies.", "140": "China dominates, but other countries make a significant contribution, especially after 2030.", "141": "However, the pace of demand growth \u2013 and the uncertainties surrounding it \u2013 also pose challenges for ensuring a secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply.",

equivalent to adding another Japan to global electricity consumption each year.", "144": "Trends vary by sector.", "145": "The transport sector has the lowest current rate of electrification in final consumption, but it also sees the fastest rate of projected demand growth as EVs account for a rising share of vehicle sales .", "146": "Increased space cooling and appliance ownership drive electricity demand growth in the buildings sector, underpinned by economic expansion.", "147": "Electrification in industry is also a significant factor.", "148": "Emerging market and developing economies are projected to contribute nearly 80% of growth in electricity demand to 2030 in the STEPS, with China alone making up over 45% of the global growth total .", "149": "China\u2019s energy sector has electrified particularly fast, with electricity rising from 11% of final consumption in 2000 to 26% in 2023: a major cause was surging electricity use in the buildings sector, with growing incomes leading to rapid increases in appliances and demand for space cooling, while space heating has also increasingly been electrified.", "150": "China\u2019s demand rises further in the coming decades, with the rapid uptake of EVs being a key driver.", "151": "The story in India is similar, though starting from a lower base: the share of electricity in final consumption rose in India from 11% in 2000 to 18% in 2023, and half of the electricity demand growth to 2050 is projected in the STEPS to come in the buildings sector.", "152": "After a period of slower growth, trends in advanced economies are changing.", "153": "In the United States, the share of electricity in final consumption was static from 2010 to 2023 at under 22%, but it rises to nearly 40% by 2050 in the STEPS, with an expanding EV fleet accounting for 65% of overall demand growth.", "154": "After falling in recent years, electricity demand in the European Union is also shifting back to growth, and the share of electricity in final consumption today more than doubles to 45% in 2050 in the STEPS.", "155": "Rising demand from EVs is again one of the main causes, along with more electrification of space heating in the buildings sector.", "156": "Electricity demand is subject to major uncertainties, and could be higher or lower than projected.", "157": "One key uncertainty revolves around possible variations in the outlook for the building sector, which in the STEPS is set to deliver nearly 45% of electricity demand growth in final consumption by 2035, mostly from increased cooling and appliance use.", "158": "Demand for space cooling in buildings rises at an average annual rate of 3,7% to 2035 in the STEPS.", "159": "Over 90% of this growth takes place in emerging market and developing economies, where economic growth and rising incomes drive air conditioner ownership, while a warming global climate boosts demand and leads to air conditioners having to work harder to provide cooling .", "160": "As well as raising overall demand, cooling is projected to lead to higher peaks in demand, putting additional strain on power grids.", "161": "Demand growth from cooling could be even stronger than projected in the STEPS.", "162": "Heat waves trigger increased demand for air conditioning, as seen in the prolonged recent heat wave in India, which reportedly doubled sales of cooling units .", "163": "A sensitivity analysis exploring the impact of more frequent, intense and lengthy heat waves on air conditioner ownership and usage finds that they could increase electricity demand for cooling in 2035 by as much as 700 TWh  more than projected in the STEPS .", "164": "About 80% of this additional increase occurs in emerging market and developing economies, mostly in developing Asia .", "165": "Energy efficiency improvements, supported by strong policy measures, are key to moderating the fast growth projected in appliance ownership, floorspace and overall living standards.", "166": "But current trends indicate limited progress on efficiency in key markets, and highlight the risk that weak, disparate efficiency standards could lock in additional demand in fast growing regions.", "167": "A sensitivity analysis indicates that lower efficiencies could cause electricity demand for appliances and cooling in emerging market and developing economies to be around 340 TWh  higher than in the STEPS by 2035.", "168": "By contrast, faster adoption of effective efficiency standards could result in electricity demand being almost 900 TWh lower in 2035 in these end uses than in the STEPS, highlighting the value of action in these areas to temper future demand growth .", "169": "Clean energy transitions are a primary cause of fast rising global electricity demand .", "170": "Faster electrification of end uses and the decarbonisation of power grids together play a vital role to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, as reflected in the APS and NZE Scenario.",

pace and scale of the electrification of transport is a key differentiator of electricity demand across the three World Energy Outlook  scenarios.", "173": "The projected share of EV sales in total road vehicle sales reaches 70% in 2035 in the APS, compared with 55% in the STEPS, and this translates into a 465 TWh increase in electricity demand from road transport in the APS compared to the STEPS.", "174": "In the NZE Scenario, near universal adoption of EVs by 2035 means a 1 500 TWh increase compared to the STEPS.", "175": "Faster uptake of heat pumps is central to efforts to boost energy efficiency and cut fossil fuel use in buildings.", "176": "Although sales of heat pumps slowed in 2023 in some regions, and saw a major slowdown in Europe in the first half of 2024, their market share in space heating is still set to almost double by 2035 in the STEPS, and to reach approximately 30% in the APS and 40% in the NZE Scenario.", "177": "Their high efficiency means the additional electricity demand from heat pumps is modest, adding only around 325 TWh by 2035 in the STEPS, 445 TWh in the APS and 425 TWh in the NZE Scenario.", "178": "The use of electricity to produce hydrogen, including onsite production for the steel, ammonia and refining industries, has the potential to increase demand for electricity very significantly.", "179": "But the scale and timing are highly uncertain because they are contingent on how quickly different hydrogen production pathways and use develop.", "180": "Electricity demand for hydrogen production increases from less than 5 TWh today to 9 000 TWh in the APS in 2050.", "181": "In the NZE Scenario, electricity demand for hydrogen production reaches nearly 15 000 TWh in 2050, equivalent to over 55% of global electricity demand today.", "182": "As societies come to depend ever more on electricity, especially in rapid energy transitions, reliable supply becomes paramount .", "183": "Rapidly scaling up low emissions sources of electricity is a central part of any clean energy transition.", "184": "While the electricity sector is the largest emitting energy sector today, a lot of action is in hand to reduce those emissions, driven by national and international commitments.", "185": "For renewables, ambitious collective goals were set at COP28, including to triple global installed capacity of

electricity demand.", "198": "Global output from low emissions sources of electricity, including all renewable energy technologies, nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture, hydrogen and ammonia, increased by 4 800 TWh from 2010 to 2023, but global electricity generation increased by nearly 8 400 TWh .", "199": "Wind and solar PV together accounted for three quarters of clean power growth over the period, and hydro, bioenergy, geothermal and nuclear power  accounted for the final quarter.", "200": "To fill the gap, global coalfired generation increased by almost 2 000 TWh  from 2010 to 2023 and gas fired output increased by over 1 700 TWh .", "201": "As a result, electricity sector CO2 emissions increased by 20% over the period, rising from 11,4 gigatonnes  in 2010 to 13,7 Gt in 2023.", "202": "In some regions, clean power has increased faster than electricity demand and reduced the need for unabated fossil fuels.", "203": "Low emissions sources of electricity grew by over 20% between 2018 and 2023 in countries including Australia, Korea, Japan, Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico: in all these countries, they outstripped any electricity demand growth, leading to reductions in the use of unabated fossil fuels .", "204": "Low emissions sources increased by around 10% or less in the European Union, United Kingdom and United States, but this was enough to outpace any demand growth and reduce the use of unabated fossil fuels in each case.", "205": "In several emerging market and developing economies, low emissions sources were not able to keep pace with overall electricity demand growth between 2018 and 2023, leading to increased use of coal and natural gas to generate power.", "206": "China is the global market leader in the deployment of clean power technologies, including solar PV, wind, hydro and nuclear power, but it has also seen coal fired power increase by over 20% and natural gas by 40% over the last five years.", "207": "Since its electricity demand is far larger than that of any other country, the speed at which China transitions to clean energy is of huge significance, and it will be a landmark day when clean power growth in China outstrips overall electricity demand.", "208": "India and Indonesia have increased clean power by 40% and 50% respectively over the past five years, but from a low starting point, and the use of unabated fossil fuels in the power sector has also increased significantly.", "209": "Given the high level of dependence on coal in both countries, their near term plans for clean energy transitions and long term commitments to reach net zero emissions are crucially important.", "210": "From 2023 to 2030, growth of clean power sources outpaces electricity demand growth globally by 20% under current policy settings and market conditions.", "211": "Renewables account for the vast majority of clean power growth to 2030, and renewables investment steps up from around USD 680 billion in 2023 to USD 850 billion in 2030, delivering annual average capacity additions of more than 600 GW of solar PV, about 160 GW of wind, around 30 GW of hydropower and 12 GW of other renewables.", "212": "In total, renewables capacity worldwide increases 2,3 fold to 2030 in the STEPS.", "213": "Nuclear power contributes to the growth of clean power sources reflecting efforts to maintain the existing fleet of nuclear reactors and construction of new reactors in around 30 countries.", "214": "As a result, electricity generation from unabated fossil fuels declines to 2030, with falls of more than 10% in coal fired power and 50% in oil fired power more than offsetting about a 5% rise for natural gas.", "215": "However, transitions away from fossil fuels must move faster to fulfil announced pledges, including the pledges to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 and to pursue net zero emissions by 2050.", "216": "In advanced economies, clean power increases twice as much as electricity demand to 2030, and both wind and solar PV individually nearly keep pace with electricity demand growth .", "217": "Nuclear power increases due to a mix of lifetime extensions, new construction, return to operation of existing reactors in France and a progressive re start of existing reactors in Japan.", "218": "Electricity generation from fossil fuels declines by 30% to 2030: coal fired power reduces by 50% and gas fired power by 15%.", "219": "In emerging market and developing economies, clean power growth starts to match strong electricity demand growth in the STEPS.", "220": "Clean power expands by 5 800 TWh from 2023 to 2030, and electricity sector CO2 emissions in emerging market and developing economies collectively peak in the mid 2020s.", "221": "Solar PV dominates, providing over half of the increase in clean power between now and 2030 in the STEPS, with wind making the second largest contribution and hydropower, other renewables and nuclear each also delivering a share of the increase.", "222": "China alone accounts for almost 70% of emerging market and developing economies clean power growth, rising fast enough to keep pace with rising demand for electricity in China.", "223": "Despite this progress in emerging market and developing economies, unabated fossil fuel use in 2030 remains nearly at current levels.", "224": "Coal fired power sees a slight decline over the years to 2030, while gas fired generation rises.", "225": "While clean power is gaining momentum, today\u2019s policy settings and market conditions do not deliver fast enough growth to move onto a pathway to net zero emissions.", "226": "In the NZE Scenario, which does move countries collectively onto such a pathway, global clean power generation increases twice as fast to 2035 as in the STEPS.", "227": "To close the gap between the STEPS and the NZE Scenario through to 2035, clean power needs to expand 1,5 times faster in China, 1,9 times faster in advanced economies, and three times faster in the other emerging market and developing economies.", "228": "The faster uptake of clean power in the NZE Scenario leads to an 85% reduction in unabated coal fired power and a 55% reduction in unabated gas fired power by 2035, compared with a 35% reduction for coal fired power and virtually no change for natural gas in the STEPS.", "229": "To create the widest path possible to net zero emissions, all clean power technologies make a bigger contribution to reducing emissions than they do in the STEPS, though these contributions are differentiated by how mature and accessible the technologies are, by their respective costs, and by technology preferences in various economies, which are often expressed through differences in national policies.", "230": "Despite their growth in the STEPS, solar PV and wind need to expand more than any other clean energy technologies to close the gap between the STEPS and the NZE Scenario, with the latter calling for an additional 7 000 TWh of solar PV and 5 000 TWh of wind by 2035 .", "231": "The additional growth required in the NZE Scenario reflects the widespread availability of solar PV and wind, the strong policy support they enjoy in most countries and their cost advantages, since they are now the cheapest new sources of electricity in most markets.", "232": "In the case of solar PV, it also reflects the excess manufacturing capacity that already exists, and which is anticipated to augment in the coming years .", "233": "A number of actions need to be taken to deliver the additional solar PV and wind called for in the NZE Scenario: these will vary from country to country but are likely in many cases to include taking immediate steps to address permitting and licensing issues, resolve grid connection delays and accelerate deployment of batteries and other energy storage technologies.", "234": "Special efforts are needed to scale up financing for clean power in emerging market and developing economies outside China .", "235": "Vital as solar PV and wind are, the deployment of a wide set of dispatchable low emissions sources, including hydropower, bioenergy and nuclear power, is essential for affordable and secure clean energy transitions.", "236": "The NZE Scenario calls for about 1 000 TWh more hydro by 2035 than the STEPS does, and for about 650 TWh more bioenergy.", "237": "While they are both mature technologies, their potential for growth is more limited than that of solar and wind, not least because of the limits on resource availability.", "238": "There is also a gap of about 1 400 TWh between the NZE Scenario and the STEPS on nuclear power.", "239": "This is significant, but much smaller than those for solar PV and wind: not all countries choose to use nuclear technology, and it involves relatively high initial costs and long construction times.", "240": "If the power sector is to lead the way to net zero emissions, new low emissions options need to be brought to market by 2035.", "241": "Small modular reactors are one of these technologies, and their development helps to accelerate the contribution of nuclear in the NZE Scenario.", "242": "The deployment of carbon capture technologies and the use of low emissions hydrogen and ammonia are also important, since they can be used to reduce emissions from existing coalfired power plants which between them would use the entire remaining carbon budget to 1,5 \u00b0C if operated as they are today .", "243": "By 2035, fossil fuels with CCUS and lowemissions hydrogen and ammonia start to make an impact in the NZE Scenario: together they deliver an additional 1 100 TWh over what is in the STEPS, setting them up to play an important part in decarbonising energy beyond 2035.", "244": "There has been a major reorientation in natural gas trade routes since the cut in Russian pipeline exports to Europe.", "245": "A large new wave of LNG export capacity is also set to come on line: if all projects that are under construction are completed on time, available liquefaction capacity is expected to rise globally from 580 bcm per year today to 850 bcm per year in 2030 .1", "246": "This increase in export capacity is larger than projected LNG demand growth in all three scenarios the result is an overhang of capacity which is set to depress international gas prices and set the stage for fierce competition between suppliers.", "247": "On average, the delivered cost of LNG is around USD 4,50/MBtu, but costs vary widely.", "248": "The most cost competitive sources of LNG are projects that have paid off their initial invested capital and that benefit from low cost feedgas and low operating costs, such as the Qatari LNG trains that started in the early 2000s.", "249": "Around 40% of existing projects have yet to recover fully their invested capital, having been online for less than the typical ten year period over which debt is recovered in project finance for large scale LNG terminals.", "250": "For projects under construction, average delivered costs are estimated to be around USD 8/MBtu, but there is a risk that this may increase due to mounting cost inflation amid a queue of projects.", "251": "Indeed, delays or significant budget overruns have already affected around 20% of the projects that have made a final investment decision since 2019.", "252": "In the STEPS, existing LNG export capacity and new capacity under construction are together sufficient to meet projected demand to 2040 .", "253": "The utilisation rates of LNG plants average around 75% of nameplate capacity between 2025 and 2035 in the STEPS, which reflects very loose market conditions.", "254": "After 2040, additional capacity is required as LNG demand continues to increase, and by 2050 the amount of additional capacity needed rises to around 180 bcm, most of which comes from the Middle East and North America.", "255": "Ample LNG supply in the second half of the 2020s raises the question of whether demand might rise higher than projected in the STEPS.", "256": "There is around 1 500 bcm of LNG import capacity around the world, and an additional 160 bcm is under construction.", "257": "This suggests that there is sufficient infrastructure in place to handle additional LNG cargoes in most importing countries.", "258": "As of mid 2024, around one third of export capacity under construction is as yet uncontracted, meaning these additional volumes will be made available on the spot market to buyers, who are likely to be interested if prices look competitive against incumbent fuels or technologies.", "259": "There are many price sensitive markets in Asia, such as those for fertiliser in India or power generation in Pakistan, which in theory could ramp up LNG imports in response to lower prices.", "260": "The problem for LNG suppliers is that, once all the costs of liquefaction, shipping and regasification are taken into account, it becomes a relatively expensive fuel, and a supplier could struggle to compete in emerging and developing markets while providing sufficient returns.", "261": "For example, in countries such as India, imported gas prices would need to be around USD 3 5/MBtu to compete with coal, and prices in that range are likely to be below the delivered cost of LNG for many export projects around the world.", "262": "In the STEPS, the degree of demand response to the LNG surplus is constrained by the projected scale of renewables deployment, a gradual reduction in the potential for increased coal to gas switching as coal plants retire, and faster efficiency gains and electrification rates than in the past.", "263": "Moreover, the markets with ample infrastructure in place to receive additional LNG, notably Europe and China, are also those that are making the most rapid progress with energy transitions, reducing the likelihood that they will absorb major additional volumes of LNG.", "264": "China in particular poses a conundrum: at around 8% in 2023, natural gas still accounts for a relatively small share of the overall energy mix, suggesting scope for expansion.", "265": "But slowing economic growth sets the stage for intense competition in the domestic market, with coal being challenged by low emissions sources that are an increasingly important source of economic growth and employment.", "266": "In today\u2019s complicated geopolitical environment, with plenty of domestic coal and fast growing clean energy sources, it is not obvious that Chinese conditions will allow for rapid expansion of an imported fuel.", "267": "It is worth noting in this context that the possibility, albeit still a distant one, of China concluding an additional gas supply contract with Russia for the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline represents a major wild card for the LNG industry, as this would significantly increase the global glut of LNG.", "268": "Accelerated climate action \u2013 as seen in the APS and NZE Scenario \u2013 would also create an even larger surplus of LNG in the coming years.", "269": "In the APS, LNG export plant utilisation rates fall to 70% in 2030, and existing LNG projects together with those under construction are able to fulfil LNG demand all the way through to 2050.", "270": "In the NZE Scenario, utilisation rates fall to less than 60% in 2030 and LNG demand through to 2050 can be met entirely by projects existing today.", "271": "In this latter scenario, we estimate that the sponsors of around 70% of LNG export projects currently under construction would struggle to recover their invested capital.", "272": "Gas prices are higher in the APS, but there are still some 80 bcm of projects, or 30% of what is currently under construction, which would not fully recover their invested capital.", "273": "Nonetheless, markets typically find ways to clear, and it is therefore worth examining the conditions under which natural gas demand growth could be more robust.", "274": "The 2010s \u2013 heralded by the IEA in a 2011 report as a potential \u201cgolden age for gas\u201d \u2013 saw natural gas demand grow on average by around 2,7% per year, and it has in addition increased by 1,2% per year on average over the past five years .", "275": "In the STEPS, natural gas demand peaks before 2030 and declines throughout the 2030s, mainly due to the rapid deployment of renewables, heat pumps and other efficiency measures.", "276": "But clean energy technologies could be adopted at a slower pace and scale than seen in the STEPS, and alongside other factors, this could lead to natural gas demand continuing to rise throughout the 2030s and beyond .", "277": "Reaching universal access to electricity and clean cooking is central to a just, people centred energy transition.", "278": "The deployment of ever more innovative, efficient and sustainable solutions has widened the range of options now available to achieve that goal while improving the quality of life of millions and reducing the impact on the environment.", "279": "Since the early 2000s, many countries have made rapid progress to extend energy access, led by developing economies in Asia and parts of Latin America .", "280": "Other countries, especially in sub Saharan Africa, have struggled to keep up with population growth.", "281": "As part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda, UN members in 2015 agreed to the goal of providing affordable, reliable and modern energy to all by 2030  \u2013 a goal that is achieved in the NZE Scenario.", "282": "IEA tracking shows that, even before the Covid 19 pandemic and the global energy crisis, a major boost in progress was needed to deliver this goal.", "283": "Recent years have seen progress slow and even go into reverse in some cases, intensifying the pressure on countries that were already facing a difficult outlook.", "284": "This raises the question of whether the 2030 goal is slipping out of reach.", "285": "Yet, there are reasons for guarded optimism.", "286": "A range of innovative energy access solutions is renewing momentum and helping to bring about faster progress in some regions.", "287": "In addition, a flurry of new policies and national plans have markedly improved the longer term outlook.", "288": "This section explores how energy access progresses under current policy settings, and where accelerated action is needed.", "289": "Progress on electricity access has been remarkable in the past decades: since 2000, the world has reduced the number of people without electricity access by 925 million, and 40 countries have reached at least near universal access to electricity.", "290": "But around 750 million people still lack access to electricity, and progress has been uneven, with only one in five of the people gaining access to electricity in this period living in Africa.", "291": "As many Asian countries near universal access, attention is increasingly turning to Africa, where it has proved more difficult to regain momentum amid the lingering effects of the crisis years, including high debt levels in many countries.", "292": "While grid connections in some countries are gradually resuming, some of this slowdown is being offset by new business models such as Pay As You Go solar PV  and digital payment systems, and by the decreasing cost of batteries and solar PV modules.", "293": "Sales of solar home systems  have increased 2,5 fold in sub Saharan Africa since 2018, and more than 90% of all the systems sold worldwide in 2023 were sold through PAYGo .", "294": "The latest IEA estimates suggest that over 40 million people in sub Saharan Africa had access to electricity via SHS in 2023, which is almost four times more than five years before.", "295": "An additional 30 million people in the region use SHS as a backup source of electricity, especially in places where the grid electricity supply tends to be unreliable.", "296": "Innovative models like Energy as a Service are showing the potential to make SHS affordable even for the poorest and most remote populations .", "297": "In addition, around 48 million people globally benefited from a mini grid connection in 2021, around 27 million of which are in subSaharan Africa .", "298": "Recent analysis indicates that 2024 might be the fastest year on record for new mini grid connections .", "299": "A crucial ingredient for successful projects is a link to local productive uses as they underpin revenue and bankability and can lead to significant local economic benefits in the longer term .", "300": "While technological improvements and innovative models are helping, they will not by themselves achieve the scale needed to reach universal access and overcome the current affordability gap.", "301": "Public interventions and targeted incentives are required if 120 million people are to gain access each year, as they must do to achieve the SDG 7,1 goal by 2030 .", "302": "Most of the progress needs to take place in sub Saharan Africa, where around 7% of the population has to gain access each year to get on track.", "303": "This pace of annual progress is not unprecedented, with comparable and higher percentages having been achieved in the past in Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and India.", "304": "In 2018, India connected almost 100 million people \u2013 equivalent to the annual effort required in subSaharan Africa to close the gap by 2030 \u2013 thanks to government initiatives aimed at expanding rural electrification, such as the Saubhagya and the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana schemes.", "305": "Around one third of the population without access to electricity, about 250 million people, live in countries where new and improved access policies and programmes have been initiated, including six countries where previous policies were expected to lead to very limited improvements.", "306": "New international financing commitments are helping draw policy attention to countries with large access gaps.", "307": "However, there will still be around 650 million people without access to electricity by 2030 in the STEPS.", "308": "More concrete measures are needed to boost progress.", "309": "Since 2000, around 1 billion people have gained access to clean cooking, and 16 countries have reached near universal access.", "310": "Progress has been concentrated in Asia and Latin America.", "311": "In much of Africa, population growth has continued to outpace improvements in access.", "312": "There is much further to go.", "313": "Today, more than 2 billion people still lack access to clean cooking, split almost equally between sub Saharan Africa and developing economies in Asia.", "314": "Among the main obstacles to further progress are affordability and limited clean cooking policies and programmes.", "315": "Countries that have recently implemented or strengthened clean cooking policies have often seen rapid progress, particularly in urban and peri urban areas.", "316": "The majority of progress so far has been achieved through the provision of LPG stoves and cylinders, and improved solid biomass stoves.", "317": "Other clean cooking fuels are proving capable of being rapidly scaled up in certain locations, notably bioethanol, biogas and electric cooking.", "318": "Bioethanol cooking has grown strongly on the back of carbon credit revenues in Kenya and has the potential to expand quickly in urban and peri urban areas in East Africa.", "319": "Efficiency induction and hyper efficient electric pressure cookers are also starting to make headway in Asia, often supported by government led campaigns to reduce LPG imports.", "320": "Access to clean cooking has gained substantial political attention in recent years, prompting a wave of new domestic and international efforts to improve access.", "321": "Around 630 million people without clean cooking access live in countries in which new and improved policy frameworks were implemented in the last two years or are under active development .", "322": "This includes new national clean cooking strategies and plans in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.", "323": "Support from the G7, G20, and the Conference of the Parties  presidencies as well as from international finance institutions helped to move the dial.", "324": "While this has improved the outlook for clean cooking since the WEO 2023, around 1,7 billion people still lack access to clean cooking by 2030 in the STEPS.", "325": "Transitional solutions like improved biomass cookstoves  could provide prompt and meaningful benefits for remote and poor households in the short term before more sustainable longer term solutions and infrastructure can be put in place.", "326": "To achieve universal energy access by 2030, around USD 55 billion in upfront investment is needed each year, around two thirds of which is required in sub Saharan Africa .", "327": "This is less than 2% of current annual energy spending.", "328": "Current investment levels are just below USD 10 billion annually.", "329": "This is much less than is needed and has decreased around 75% from pre COVID19 levels.", "330": "However, the decrease is due in part to large economies having made rapid progress in the intervening years and achieving near universal access to electricity.", "331": "Affordability constraints mean that private capital can only cover a small share of the financing that is needed for energy access, while African governments already face rising debt sustainability concerns.", "332": "This means that the allocation of official development assistance to energy in Africa is vitally important if faster progress is to be made, but the level of such assistance for energy projects has remained static over the past decade.", "333": "Without a stronger international commitment to universal energy access, there is a risk that many developing economies may be left behind.", "334": "The new collective quantified goal on climate finance could be used as a vehicle to close at least part of the funding gap.", "335": "Renewed attention to energy access issues within international climate finance and development assistance is already providing a boost to concessional capital for access.", "336": "The \u201cMission 300\u201d programme, which aims to provide 300 million people with electricity access, has received initial pledges of USD 30 billion and aims to reach around USD 90 billion.", "337": "An additional USD 2,2 billion of private and public sector finance for clean cooking was pledged at the IEA Summit for Clean Cooking in Africa in May 2024, on top of the USD 2 billion committed by the African Development Bank at the COP28.", "338": "Implementing these commitments remains a challenge.", "339": "The small size of projects, especially for clean cooking and rural off grid electrification, and the lack of established private sector players in some locations, make it more difficult to disburse money fast and effectively.", "340": "On top of this, household affordability constraints, evolving pricing regulation and a lack of credible benchmarks increase the real and perceived risks for energy access projects.", "341": "Plans to improve electricity access are more likely to attract support and to succeed if they identify productive uses and anchor loads, for example small industries, agricultural pumps, communication towers, and if they lead to the displacement of diesel and petrol generators.", "342": "Targeting institutional facilities and peri urban areas has proved to be successful to extend access to clean cooking while creating momentum.", "343": "Recent shifts in the use of concessional finance such as guarantees and first loss capital are helping to attract rising levels of private capital.", "344": "The share of private finance in both electricity and clean cooking access projects neared 50% in 2019, up from 30% for electricity in 2013, and from less than 10% for clean cooking.", "345": "The availability of commercial private capital is expected to continue to rise but is likely to focus on more profitable projects, such as those in urban and high demand areas.", "346": "Public and concessional finance remains fundamental to reach poor and more remote areas.", "347": "Carbon market financing for clean cooking projects has also been on the rise, with over 40 million credits issued in 2023, accounting for 15% of all carbon credits issued globally and up ten times from 2013.", "348": "Concerns about the rigour of cookstoves credits have hampered the market, but new initiatives and methodologies, notably the CLEAR 2 methodology, aim to meet those concerns.", "349": "Despite the progress that is being made, the goal of universal access cannot be delivered without improved policies and an increase in funding support, particularly in Africa.", "350": "Calls for more climate finance need to be heeded, and to be accompanied by continued efforts to ramp up private sector involvement.", "351": "All of this ultimately depends on unwavering commitment to achieve universal access on the part of the governments of the countries where progress is needed, together with strengthened commitment on the part of the international community, including international financial institutions.", "352": "Global energy sector investment reached around USD 2,9 trillion in 2023 and is likely to exceed USD 3 trillion for the first time in 2024, with almost USD 2 invested in a range of clean energy technologies and infrastructure for every USD 1 spent on fossil fuels.", "353": "Prior to the Covid 19 pandemic, this ratio was closer to 1:1.", "354": "Global investment in clean energy has increased by 60% since 2015, driven not only by emissions reduction goals, but also by robust underlying economics, considerations of energy security during a period of extreme volatility in fossil fuel prices, and competition among leading economies for positions in the new clean energy economy that will be an important source of growth and employment in the coming years.", "355": "Recent increases in clean energy investment come mostly from advanced economies and China, making up 85% of the total, while other emerging market and developing economies, home to two thirds of the global population, account for just 15% .", "356": "This misalignment is a major concern, given that demand for energy services in developing economies will inevitably increase in the coming years to support rising standards of living, universal access to energy and construction of modern infrastructure.", "357": "The high cost of capital and lack of affordable long term financing is a key contributor to these regional imbalances and an impediment to increasing capital flows to emerging market and developing economies in the future.", "358": "Investment in clean energy projects increase in all parts of the world in the NZE Scenario, but the regional imbalances mean that the required increase is particularly steep in emerging market and developing economies other than China.", "359": "In the NZE Scenario, annual spending on clean energy doubles in advanced economies and in China by 2035 compared with 2023 levels, while it grows more than six fold in other developing economies .", "360": "The surge in clean energy spending that is required in both the APS and NZE scenario can appear daunting for emerging market and developing economies .", "361": "But many examples show that a clear vision for energy transitions, supported by sound policies, regulations and private sector engagement, can drive growth in both the quantity and quality of clean energy investments.", "362": "And the benefits of these investments go well beyond mitigating climate change .", "363": "Many clean energy facilities, once installed, tend to have lower operating costs than fossil fuel facilities, and are not financially exposed to volatile fuel costs.", "364": "This can bring major long term energy and economic security gains especially for economies highly dependent on fuel imports.", "365": "Closing the clean energy investment gap in developing economies requires mobilising capital and channelling it to sectors that present different degrees and types of risks to investors.", "366": "For instance, the challenges and business models that are relevant to a utility scale solar PV project with a long term contract are different from those that arise in connection with a transmission line financed on balance sheet by a state owned utility, or an electric car that is paid for by a household with consumer finance or their own savings.", "367": "Risks can also vary for different projects within a single sector and for similar projects in different countries, since factors like political and macroeconomic stability and the rule of law have broad consequences for risk perceptions and therefore also for the cost of capital.", "368": "The prospects for scaling up clean energy investment in all sectors depend to a large extent on policy certainty, data reliability and strong governance.", "369": "Making improvements in these areas is therefore critically important.", "370": "This needs to be accompanied and facilitated by significant increases in international public financial and technical support, including larger volumes of concessional funding to bring in much higher multiples of private capital.", "371": "By 2030 in the NZE Scenario, annual concessional funding for the energy sector triples to reach over USD 100 billion in developing economies other than China.", "372": "However, not all projects need public financial support.", "373": "In considering how to scale up investment, it is useful to break down the overall requirement into categories that reflect particular characteristics and risk profiles.", "374": "In work undertaken in support of the Brazilian G20 presidency in 2024, the following three groupings were proposed.", "375": "The first group covers investment in mature clean energy technologies with relatively low risk and strong underlying economics in countries with relatively good credit rating.", "376": "These can usually be privately led, provided that investors have confidence in the quality of the policy and regulatory environment.", "377": "For example, utility scale solar PV and wind projects in Brazil or in India have built up a successful track record of mobilising private capital for several years, and only limited interventions are required on the financing side from the public sector.", "378": "In the NZE Scenario, the total clean energy investment requirement in developing economies other than China in 2035 is around USD 1,8 trillion, and our assessment is that around 40% of the investment falls into this privately led category.", "379": "The second group of projects, accounting for around half of the 2035 clean energy requirement in the NZE Scenario, needs to be facilitated by some form of risk mitigation based on collaboration between the public and private sectors.", "380": "These facilitated interventions cover technologies that have reached commercial maturity in some markets but have yet to take off in a specific developing economy, for example a utilityscale solar PV in a nascent market like Cambodia, and emerging technologies in relatively low risk jurisdictions that require additional support for the first commercial scale projects, for example a low emissions hydrogen project in Chile.", "381": "They also cover projects where the national creditworthiness is low and a constraint on investors, or where significant social returns, such as those arising from improved energy access, need some form of public support to ensure affordability and bankability.", "382": "The third group, accounting for around 6% of projects, concerns investment for which commercial capital is either not available or is too costly to access because the real and perceived risks are very high.", "383": "These investments need to be publicly driven.", "384": "They include projects in some of the least developed countries in the world, and projects in countries involved in or emerging from conflicts, as well as those involving some nascent technologies or aspects of public infrastructure that require substantial public support to lower costs.", "385": "These three categories help to differentiate the types and scale of finance that may be required to advance clean energy transitions in emerging market and developing economies, and to provide a means of identifying the cases that require additional support from public financial institutions, including the strategic use of concessional financing to bring in much larger volumes of private capital.", "386": "Facilitated interventions need to be designed in ways that not only help individual projects to move ahead but also clear the path for more projects to follow without the same level of support.", "387": "Concessional funding is scarce and needs to be deployed in ways that allow its impact to be sustained even when the funding itself is withdrawn.", "388": "In essence this means helping projects to move to a point where they can be led by the private sector.", "389": "The key to this is to consider reforms that address underlying barriers as part of the process of designing and implementing interventions, and to standardise, to the extent possible, the underlying documentation, for example for power purchase agreements.", "390": "Scaling up clean energy requires integrated policy approaches and system wide planning.", "391": "In the power sector, for example, bringing in new sources of generation, especially variable ones like solar PV and wind, requires the flexible operation of other generation assets and measures to expand and modernise grids and storage.", "392": "In countries with large coal fired power generation fleets, this means repurposing coal plants to provide balancing services, or making provisions for early plant retirements to allow clean sources to expand, prioritising the retirement of older, less efficient units.", "393": "It also means full recognition of the importance of demand side measures and energy efficiency.", "394": "Scaling up also means identifying and developing new sources of finance.", "395": "For the moment, domestic sources of capital account for most of the financing for clean energy investment projects in developing economies.", "396": "This finding is heavily conditioned by the weight of China in the overall numbers, as more than 90% of clean energy projects in China are funded by domestic sources.", "397": "But domestic funding has also been crucial in other developing economies that have successfully scaled up clean energy investment, including India and South Africa.", "398": "Deeper local capital markets in other jurisdictions can help finance flow to projects in clean energy, while developing secondary markets from operating assets with stable revenue streams can also help recycle capital into new projects.", "399": "The volume of investment required for successful clean energy transitions therefore necessitates a greater role for international capital.", "400": "As an example, developing economies other than China see a sharp increase in capital flows from international sources, from 20% in 2023 to 35% in the NZE Scenario in 2035.", "401": "Financing instruments such as green, social, sustainable and sustainability linked bonds have the potential to mobilise private capital at scale by attracting institutional investors that do not typically invest in individual projects.", "402": "Project aggregation platforms and securitisation vehicles are also necessary to overcome the asymmetry between the relatively small size of most clean energy projects, especially in the end use sector, in developing economies and the comparatively large minimum investment size that institutional investors typically require.", "403": "The World Energy Outlook 2024 unfolds against a complex and uncertain backdrop.", "404": "The immediate impact of the shocks from the Covid 19 pandemic and the global energy crisis spurred by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are diminishing, but the damage to public finances and to international co operation will take longer to repair.", "405": "Countries representing half of global energy demand are voting in national or regional elections in 2024 climate and energy related issues feature prominently in many campaigns.", "406": "The spectre of spiralling conflicts across the Middle East also highlights key energy security risks in the current system, while decades of accumulated emissions are accentuating the risks from extreme weather.", "407": "Today\u2019s broad trends underscore the urgency of transforming the energy sector even as they also complicate its achievement in practice.", "408": "In these circumstances, the continued momentum and resilience of clean energy transitions is remarkable.", "409": "Since 2020, investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure has increased by 60% the amount of capital invested each year to support clean energy projects is now twice the amount invested in fossil fuels.", "410": "This is boosting the contribution that clean energy makes to the global energy mix, even though the majority of growth in global energy demand is currently still being met by fossil fuels.", "411": "The extent and speed of structural changes in the energy sector and their implications for energy security, affordability and emissions are central themes in this Outlook.", "412": "Our scenario analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options, not to predict how they will act, and none of the

demand, and to assess the wider implications these have for energy and emissions.", "415": "Announced Pledges Scenario outlines a trajectory for the energy sector if all national energy and climate pledges, including long term net zero emissions goals, are met on time and in full.", "416": "Net Zero Emissions by 2050  Scenario portrays a pathway in which the energy sector achieves net zero carbon dioxide  emissions globally by 2050, in line with limiting the long term global average temperature to 1,5 degrees Celsius , along with achieving universal energy access by 2030 and air quality objectives.", "417": "This chapter sets the scene for subsequent analyses by outlining the current context for energy use and emissions, broad macroeconomic and investment trends, and policy and geopolitical uncertainties.", "418": "It then goes into more detail on the scenarios used in this Outlook, discussing how and why they differ from each other, the underlying policy, economic and demographic drivers, energy and carbon prices, and technology costs.", "419": "Following an increase of 8 exajoules  in 2022, global energy demand increased by around 13 EJ in 2023, pushing up global demand by 2%.", "420": "This reflects a growing requirement for energy in emerging market and developing economies which more than cancelled out a fall in energy demand in advanced economies of around 2%.", "421": "There was a large increase in both oil and coal use globally, and two thirds of the total increase in energy demand in 2023 was met by fossil fuels .", "422": "Global oil demand increased by 2 million barrels per day  in 2023 to 99 mb/d.", "423": "This increase was nearly double the average annual increase between 2010 and 2019 and was led by increases in oil use as a petrochemical feedstock in China \u2013 where total oil demand increased by 1,5 mb/d \u2013 and by continued global growth in oil demand in the transport sector.", "424": "Demand in advanced economies fell by around 0,3 mb/d.", "425": "Oil demand trends in 2024 show a sharp slowdown in demand growth, notably in China, which is expected to result in an overall rise for the year of less than 1 mb/d.", "426": "Global coal demand increased by just over 100 million tonnes of coal equivalent  in 2023 to around 6 000 Mtce, mainly because of increased use in the power sector in China and India.", "427": "Demand in advanced economies fell by more than 120 Mtce, about 10%, with coal use in the United States and European Union power sectors dropping by 20 25%.", "428": "Demand in 2024 is expected to be slightly higher than in 2023 as strong electricity demand in China and India result in higher coal demand that more than offsets continued cuts in coal use in the European Union.", "429": "Natural gas demand worldwide rose by 20 billion cubic metres  in 2023 to 4 190 bcm.", "430": "There were large increases in demand in the power sector in North America and in the buildings and industry sectors in the Middle East.", "431": "These were partially offset by a 40 bcm decline in Europe, which reduced its natural gas demand by around 7% in 2023.", "432": "This follows a reduction of 13% in 2022 and means that gas demand in Europe is now at its lowest level since the early 1990s.", "433": "Preliminary data suggest that global natural gas demand increased by 50 bcm in the first half of 2024, mainly as a result of increases in natural gas use in the industry and power sectors in Asia.", "434": "Total energy supply from low emissions sources of energy reached a record high in 2023, led by increases in China and Europe.", "435": "In the electricity sector, more than 560 gigawatts  of new renewable power capacity were added in 2023, accounting for around 80% of total new power sector capacity additions worldwide.", "436": "China alone added more than 350 GW of new renewables capacity, and its renewable generation increased by 235 terawatt hours , which is similar to the total amount of renewable electricity generated in Japan in 2023.", "437": "Liquid biofuels supply increased by 7% in 2023 to 2,3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day , mainly because of new renewable diesel refining capacity in the United States and new bioethanol capacity in Brazil.", "438": "The supply of biomethane, an upgraded form of biogas, rose by 10% in 2023 to around 10 bcm reflecting enhanced policy support in Europe and the United States.", "439": "Nuclear generation rose by 3%, in large part due to the restart of some existing reactors in Japan.", "440": "The energy intensity of the global economy improved by around 1% in 2023, following a 2% decline in 2022, meaning that the efficiency with which the global economy uses energy is continuing to make progress.", "441": "In the European Union, energy intensity improved by 5% in 2023 as measures put in place to tackle the energy crisis continued to drive down energy use and as energy intensive industrial output declined.", "442": "Globally, the share of total car sales accounted for by plug in hybrid and battery electric models rose from 14% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and is set to rise above 20% in 2024.",

a record high of 37,7 gigatonnes  .", "446": "Emissions from coal drove most of the increase.", "447": "Energy related CO2 emissions were about 1 Gt higher in 2023 than in 2019.", "448": "The world has clearly not yet turned the corner on emissions.", "449": "Nevertheless, the clean energy economy is having an effect: the increase in emissions since 2019 would have been three times as large without the expanding deployment of clean energy technologies .", "450": "The hottest year in recorded history was 2023.", "451": "Temperatures by mid 2024 suggest that this record is highly likely to be broken again.", "452": "The 12 month period to May 2024 saw 76 extreme heat events worldwide, with damaging consequences for infrastructure, healthcare services, vulnerable populations and the natural environment .", "453": "Although it is not yet possible to be certain, the 12 month period from July 2023 to June 2024 may have seen global average surface temperatures of 1,5 \u00b0C higher than pre industrial levels , and the World Meteorological Organization  declared an approximately 50% chance that the temperature rise will exceed 1,5 \u00b0C on average over the 2024 2028 period .", "454": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  warns that the severity of the impacts of global warming are expected to escalate dramatically if the temperature rise does go above 1,5 \u00b0C.", "455": "However, the 1,5 \u00b0C threshold, as set out in the Paris Agreement, applies to long term warming, rather than single year or short term periods, which are strongly affected by natural weather variability.", "456": "The IPCC often uses an averaging period of 20 years to remove the impact of natural variability when considering whether a given warming level has been crossed.", "457": "Even if the temperature rise exceeds 1,5 \u00b0C for a short period, the temperature rise can be brought back below 1,5 \u00b0C with concerted long term action .", "458": "Following a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates and inflation in the 2010s, the macroeconomic context was significantly changed in the space of a few years by the Covid 19 pandemic and the global energy crisis triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.", "459": "To combat the rising inflation that emerged as the landscape changed, central banks progressively tightened their monetary policy, which led to the steepest interest rate increases seen in decades.", "460": "Advanced economies raised rates by an average of 290 basis points  in 2023 over the average level in 2022 and emerging market and developing economies by 150 basis points .", "461": "Inflation has eased in most regions so far in 2024 and there have been interest rates cuts in a number of countries, particularly in advanced economies.", "462": "However, inflation and interest rates currently are still much higher than they have been over the past 15 years in most economies.", "463": "Inflation remains a particular problem in a number of emerging market and developing economies, including Brazil, India and South Africa, and interest rate cuts there are likely to be slower.", "464": "The energy crisis clearly showed the role that energy prices can play in inflation, with price spikes contributing approximately one third of the increase in headline inflation between 2021 2023 .", "465": "The driver was not clean energy it was spikes in the prices of oil, natural gas and coal after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and cuts in Russian gas supply to Europe .", "466": "Increases in energy prices, whether from temporary spikes or more structural changes, have a major impact on household bills.", "467": "In both advanced and emerging market and developing economies, the median household spends around 10% of their disposable income on residential energy and transport fuels.", "468": "Direct consumption of oil, electricity and gas in emerging market and developing economies is only one third of the level in advanced economies, but disposable income is also much lower.", "469": "Oil currently accounts for around half of total consumer energy expenditure worldwide, meaning that oil price volatility has a particularly significant impact on consumer energy expenditure.", "470": "There are several near term downside risks for global economic growth.", "471": "In 2024 and 2025 growth is expected to be lower than the 2010 2019 average in countries comprising more than 80% of global output and population .", "472": "High debt levels and interest rates in many economies are likely to squeeze government spending, potentially delaying or decreasing investment in energy infrastructure.", "473": "They are also likely to reduce household spending, which could lead to a slowdown of the economy and higher unemployment.", "474": "Further macroeconomic risks include trade fragmentation as well as geopolitical and policy uncertainty .", "475": "The economic slowdown is pronounced in emerging market and developing economies: nearly 60% of the growth forecasts for these economies made by the International Monetary Fund  in April 2024 are lower than the forecasts made in April 2023  and their aggregate rate of economic growth is expected to slow from 4,2% in 2023 to 4% in 2024 .", "476": "Per capita income growth is set to average just 3% through to 2026, below the 2010 2019 average of 3,3%, and many emerging market and developing economies are now unlikely to see any relative economic catch up with advanced economies in the near term.", "477": "This slowdown puts recent progress on poverty reduction at risk of stalling or reversing.", "478": "These imbalances are also reflected in flows of capital to clean energy projects .", "479": "Global clean energy investment has increased rapidly over the last five years, but nearly all of the increase has been in advanced economies and China, with China accounting for an especially large share of spending relative to its gross domestic product .", "480": "Increasing capital flows to clean energy projects in other emerging market and developing economies will be essential to meet their rapidly rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way and to support economic growth.", "481": "However, involvement of private capital in many of these countries is still limited and faces a variety of headwinds.", "482": "The higher interest rate environment has pushed up financing costs, and expected levels of returns on investment are impacted by higher real and perceived risks of new clean energy projects in these markets.", "483": "A major reason for the uncertain political context is the large number of elections that have been or are being held in 2024 around the world, which affect the population in over 80 countries that account for half of global energy demand .", "484": "The global energy crisis put energy and other pressures on the cost of living at the heart of many voter concerns.", "485": "The prominence of energy related issues in many campaigns suggests that elections could bring some changes in emphasis and direction for energy policies.", "486": "In some cases, these could reinforce the momentum behind clean energy transitions in others, they could lead to a slower pace of change.", "487": "In the meantime, uncertainty may deter energy investment, particularly in large scale projects in new or emerging technologies that are particularly sensitive to policy and regulatory changes .", "488": "Energy markets also remain vulnerable to geopolitical events.", "489": "The initial price shocks from the global energy crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine abated during the first quarter of 2024 as natural gas prices dropped to slightly above pre crisis levels, though prices remain above their 2023 levels across the main Asian and European markets due to a combination of robust demand and short term constraints on liquefied natural gas  supply.", "490": "Further shocks arising from the continuing war in Ukraine cannot be ruled out.", "491": "There are other geopolitical tensions that could trigger disruption and price shocks in energy markets.", "492": "There are particularly high risks in the Middle East with the spectre of spiralling regional hostilities, as well as attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.", "493": "Since 2021, Europe, Japan and Korea have taken an increased share of their oil imports from the Middle East in the wake of sanctions imposed on Russia, and China has seen a similar trend .", "494": "Imports of Russian oil to India increased from 2% of total oil imports in 2021 to 35% in 2023.", "495": "For the moment, these geopolitical risks have not been reflected in prices, but a broader regional conflict could have major implications for oil and natural gas markets.", "496": "More than 20 mb/d of oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, 75% of which goes to Asia, and a further 7,5 mb/d of oil passes through the Suez Canal.", "497": "Annual flows of LNG through the Strait of Hormuz are more than 100 bcm, nearly 80% of which is delivered to Asian markets.", "498": "Clean energy supply chains are also subject to geopolitical tensions.", "499": "At present, China produces more than 80% of the world\u2019s battery cells and solar photovoltaic  modules, and 65% of wind nacelles .", "500": "It dominates the midstream refining and processing of critical minerals, accounting for 65% of global processing for lithium and over 75% for cobalt and nearly all the graphite anode supply chain.", "501": "China currently produces two thirds of the world's electric vehicles .", "502": "Investment in these areas has picked up in the United States, European Union, India and elsewhere, and China\u2019s share in global EV sales slipped from 70% in 2022 to 65% in 2023, but it is still very large.", "503": "Consumers around the world have benefited from the reductions in technology costs that large scale supply chain investment has brought.", "504": "Nonetheless, such a high degree of concentration presents risks.", "505": "If disruptions were to occur, the nature and severity of its effects might well depend on whether it resulted from geopolitical issues, extreme weather or industrial accidents.", "506": "Many countries are seeking to promote more diverse patterns of investment and manufacturing in clean energy supply, including for critical minerals.", "507": "This has resulted in a marked increase in the number of trade policies and other measures focussed on clean energy technologies since 2020.", "508": "Tariff adjustments, antidumping duties and countervailing measures are at the centre of the most recent trade policies.", "509": "For example, several regions, such as the United States and European Union, have announced additional duties on solar PV, EVs and batteries from China.", "510": "There have also been revisions to import tariffs on some clean energy technologies and components in Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, T\u00fcrkiye and United States.", "511": "While these could lead to more diversified supplies, a balance is required that

have seen countries place more focus on bolstering domestic manufacturing, with a particular interest in clean technology sectors .", "573": "For example, both the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act marked a reorientation of industrial policies towards incentives for domestic manufacturing.", "574": "Around 10% of the USD 2 trillion explicitly earmarked globally for direct clean energy investment support since 2020 comes with conditions that require local content in one way or another, for example by specifying minimum levels of local labour, domestically sourced materials and components, or by requiring the building of specialised factories in the country concerned .", "575": "New project announcements for manufacturing capacity are taken into account when considering technology choices in all the WEO scenarios.", "576": "Governments employ measures other than direct production incentives to support domestic manufacturers, and not all appear directly on their fiscal balance sheets.", "577": "Such support includes capital injections from state owned entities, below market rate lending and energy prices, preferential terms to access infrastructure and services, and allowances such as for land.", "578": "Firms in countries with a large number of major state owned enterprises sometimes receive disproportionately more support overall than firms based in other jurisdictions.", "579": "For example, grants and below market borrowing account for an estimated 3% of the revenues of firms based in China, compared with less than 0,1% in advanced economies

the prevailing policy settings, whatever they might be.", "582": "Policy settings can and do change from year to year, and any such policy changes are incorporated into successive editions of the STEPS.", "583": "Some changes roll back commitments to emissions reductions or clean energy deployment.", "584": "This applies both to sustainability targets and the enabling measures that are designed to reach them.", "585": "In some cases, these changes happen because ambitions were set at a level that now appears to be unrealistic.", "586": "In 2019, for example, the administration in Scotland committed itself to a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions by 2030 from their 1990 level.", "587": "This target is now set to be dropped.", "588": "At corporate level, there are many examples of firms adjusting their near term targets, usually making them less stringent, in response to unfavourable market conditions, doubts surrounding government policy, or a realisation that achieving targets would be more difficult than initially assumed.", "589": "In other cases, decision makers have argued that too much emphasis was being placed on energy transition measures at the expense of other goals, including those related to energy security and affordability, and changes in response to this sometimes mean longer timelines for introducing new technologies, or reduced incentives and policy support for their deployment.", "590": "The effects of such changes will vary by country and technology: supportive policies are important, but they are not the only driver of change .", "591": "In a year of elections around the world, there is even more uncertainty than usual over the future evolution of energy and climate policies.", "592": "In all cases, we will continue to track policies and their implementation very closely in the WEO and provide a neutral and dispassionate assessment of what they mean for the future of energy, as well as their implications for energy security, affordability and emissions.", "593": "The global economy is assumed to grow on average by 2,7% each year to 2050 in all three scenarios .", "594": "This growth rate varies by country, region and over time, influenced by factors such as investment dynamics, employment rates and shifts in trade.", "595": "We recognise that the speed, structure, and selection of policy and

jeopardise climate goals .", "608": "The production plans and resilience of major resource holders strongly influence prices in our scenarios.", "609": "In the STEPS and APS, continued market management by major producers is assumed to keep prices at higher levels than implied by the global supply cost curve.", "610": "In the NZE Scenario, producer economies may struggle to manage strains placed on their fiscal balances from reductions in oil and gas income, and this could lead to higher and more volatile prices.", "611": "Natural gas markets gradually rebalanced in 2023 as a result of timely policy actions in response to the global energy crisis, increased global LNG exports, and favourable weather conditions.", "612": "In the STEPS, the US natural gas price rises to 2030 to ensure a smooth balance between domestic supply, demand and exports.", "613": "In parallel, global gas trade continues to pivot toward LNG, and portfolio players act as important intermediaries between supply and demand.", "614": "The large number of new LNG liquefaction facilities coming online over the period to 2030 leads to supply capacity in excess of global LNG demand.", "615": "Prices in 2030 in Europe, Japan and China fall to levels substantially lower than those seen in 2023, as rapid growth in renewables and electrification limits the potential for a robust demand response to ample LNG

steadily, but prices still fall by around 30 50% to 2030 in importing regions.", "622": "In the APS, a faster decline in demand allows for the closure of some high cost mines, leading to a deeper fall in prices.", "623": "In the NZE Scenario, only the lowest cost mines are needed, and prices drop to very low levels.", "624": "Higher than expected growth in coal consumption in China or India, as well as unfavourable conditions for renewable energy production, for example low precipitation, light winds, could pose upside risks to coal prices.", "625": "Conversely, the development of new coal mines could weigh on prices if coal fired power plants face tougher competition from solar power.", "626": "We do not yet model full long term supply demand balances for critical minerals in the same way as for fuels, but we do undertake market monitoring and scenario benchmarking.", "627": "The prices of many critical minerals \u2013 particularly for batteries \u2013 fell in 2023 after two years of dramatic increases.", "628": "Lithium spot prices fell by 75% and other key materials such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite saw price drops of 30 45%.", "629": "However, copper prices remained at elevated levels, and with the exception of cobalt and graphite, the prices of most critical minerals are higher than the average levels seen in the 2010s.", "630": "The drop in critical mineral prices stemmed mainly from a rapid ramp up in supply in 2023.", "631": "A number of new projects came online relatively quickly, adding sizeable volumes to the supply pool, and the ramp up of new supply has outpaced demand growth over the past two years.", "632": "An inventory overhang in the downstream battery sector also played a role.", "633": "Price declines helped reduce the cost of clean technologies, but also caused financial difficulties for some existing and planned supply projects.", "634": "Today, just under one quarter of global GHG emissions are covered by a carbon price

initiatives rising continuously and carbon taxes and other non market mechanisms remaining constant unless scheduled to increase.", "638": "It sees the EU ETS CO2 price for power generation rise to just under USD 160/tonne CO2 in 2050.", "639": "In the APS, net zero emissions pledges lead to higher CO2 prices across all regions, with prices rising by 2050 to USD 200/tonne CO2 on average in advanced economies, and to USD 160/tonne CO2 in China, India and Indonesia.", "640": "In the NZE Scenario, carbon prices are introduced in all regions and cover most sectors: they rise to USD 250/tonne CO2 in 2050 in advanced economies and USD 200/tonne CO2 in major economies including China, Brazil, India and South Africa, with lower price levels elsewhere .", "641": "As with other policy measures, carbon prices are assumed to be introduced with careful consideration of the consequences for tax burdens and the potential for negative distributional impacts.", "642": "The level of carbon prices included in our scenarios should be interpreted with caution: the scenarios include several other energy policies and accompanying measures designed to reduce CO2 emissions, and this means that the carbon prices shown do not necessarily reflect the marginal costs of abatement.", "643": "There is a large difference between wholesale prices for fuels and the retail prices paid by consumers.", "644": "Retail prices reflect the cost of producing fuels that end users need and the cost of delivering them: they commonly include the costs of transport, refining, marketing and distribution, as well as customs duties, excise taxes, value added taxes and subsidies, all of which vary between, and sometimes within, countries.", "645": "Retail prices are generally higher than wholesale prices, and sometimes much higher.", "646": "For example, the average retail price of gasoline in Europe is around two and ahalf times the wholesale price of oil, with taxes accounting for around half of the retail price paid by consumers.", "647": "Conversely, in the Middle East, subsidies mean the retail price for gasoline is on average lower than the wholesale price .", "648": "Assumptions about the phase out of fossil fuel consumption subsidies vary by scenario: in the STEPS, for example, they are only removed if there is a specific commitment to do so.", "649": "Retail prices and wholesale prices do not always move in tandem.", "650": "For example, the average wholesale natural gas price in Europe fell by two thirds in 2023, while the average retail price increased by 14% as measures introduced by governments to keep retail prices from rising significantly during the global energy crisis came to an end in many countries.", "651": "Retail electricity prices tend to be less volatile than other retail fuel prices because around half of electricity demand globally is in markets with regulated prices based on average costs.", "652": "Supply chain pressures and higher critical minerals prices pushed up the cost of a number of key clean energy technologies in 2021 and 2022 .", "653": "These pressures eased in 2023, and costs in most cases started to fall back.", "654": "The IEA Clean Energy Equipment Price Index tracks price movements in a global basket of solar PV modules, wind turbines and lithium ion batteries for EVs and battery storage, weighted by shares of investment.", "655": "Costs for most clean energy technologies have resumed a downward path and the fourth quarter of 2023 saw the index falling to its lowest ever level.", "656": "The drop in critical mineral prices in 2023 led to a 10% reduction in that industry\u2019s revenue and a 34% fall in operating profits.", "657": "Lower prices may stimulate an acceleration in clean energy technology deployment in the medium term, but they could lead to longer term risks if they constrain investment and the critical mineral industry's ability to develop new supply projects.", "658": "Given the importance of critical minerals to the cost of clean energy technologies and expected demand growth in the use of clean technologies, reduced investment could lead to future supply shortages and price spikes.", "659": "This could slow reductions in clean energy technology costs, or even increase them, as happened in 2022 with battery pack prices, potentially hindering clean energy technology deployment.", "660": "In the IEA Global Energy and Climate Model, the future evolution of technology costs depends on continued research, improvements in manufacturing and learning by doing.", "661": "These costs are linked to levels of deployment and vary by scenario.", "662": "They do not follow a linear path.", "663": "A typical curve has the steepest rate of cost reduction in the earliest phases of innovation and deployment, when overall costs are still high: costs then fall more slowly as technologies mature.", "664": "Policies play a crucial role in this process, particularly in determining how quickly new clean technologies are scaled up in sectors such as shipping, aviation and heavy industry.", "665": "The recent evolution of upstream oil and gas costs also shows short term fluctuations.", "666": "The IEA Upstream Oil and Gas Capital Cost Index, which tracks how the capital costs of a set of representative upstream oil and gas projects around the world evolve over time, rose by close to 7% in 2022 as a result of higher raw material prices and constrained markets for services and labour.", "667": "Costs fell slightly in 2023 as inflation eased, but the drop was smaller than seen in batteries and solar PV.", "668": "Upstream costs in 2023, however, were still nearly 15% below 2014 levels following extensive efforts by operators in recent years to downsize and simplify project designs to maintain competitiveness.", "669": "Solar PV module prices fell by 30% in 2023.", "670": "A recent surge in solar production capacity in China is decreasing

2023, triple the 2019 level.", "672": "Battery pack prices dropped by 14% in 2023 to a record low of USD 139 per kilowatt hour  following reductions in battery critical mineral prices and a surge in battery cell production capacity .", "673": "Since 2013, battery pack costs have fallen almost sixfold due to economies of scale and manufacturing optimisation.", "674": "However, the proportion of costs accounted for by the cost of cathode raw materials in the battery pack price has been rising.", "675": "Around 30% of the cost of a battery pack now depends on the cost of critical minerals, and battery costs are increasingly susceptible to mineral price volatility.", "676": "Material substitution can mitigate price volatility to an extent, as it did when lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry displaced nickel rich battery chemistries during the recent years of high nickel and cobalt prices.", "677": "However, there is no alternative at present for some of the critical minerals used for particular functions in battery packs, including copper in the current collector in lithium ion battery anodes and graphite in lithium ion batteries.", "678": "Manufacturing costs for wind turbines rose in second quarter 2023 as a result of an increase in steel and freight costs.", "679": "Companies in China have so far proven able to produce wind turbines at lower cost than their European counterparts.", "680": "However, this has not translated into a large increase in exports due in large part to the costs and logistical complexities of moving large wind turbines very long distances.", "681": "Offshore wind has higher upfront costs than onshore wind and solar PV.", "682": "In 2023, developers struggled with project profitability due to inflation, high interest rates and supply chain challenges in connection with large turbine manufacturing and installation.", "683": "Several contracts were cancelled because previously agreed prices became unviable.", "684": "As ever, governments will need to pay close attention to market and cost dynamics as they design policies and support schemes for emerging technologies.", "685": "Tensions in global energy markets calmed to a degree in 2023, and global energy demand rebounded by 2,1%, which means that the rate of growth was above its average rate from 2000 to 2019.", "686": "Population growth and rising incomes continued to spur higher consumer demand for energy services, and patterns of demand continued to evolve, with data centres and artificial intelligence requiring increasing amounts of energy, for example.",

resources, but to look in detail at demand for energy services.", "689": "In other words, we look first at how much light, heat, mobility and information services communities, industries and countries around the world are likely to need over the decades to 2050.", "690": "Government policies lay the foundation, and over 5 000 policies in countries around the world have been collected, documented and analysed by technology and sector.", "691": "Levels of energy services demand increase at broadly the same rate in each of our scenarios as the global economy grows, with two important exceptions.", "692": "The first concerns progress towards universal access to modern energy: this varies by scenario, which affects the level of demand for energy services because progress towards achievement of this goal invariably leads to higher use of energy services in many countries for lighting, cooling, and appliance and equipment use.", "693": "The second concerns the adoption of behavioural changes and mode shifts: these too vary by scenario, and the differences affect the level of energy service demand, for example when substituting public transport, walking or cycling for short car journeys or increasing the recycling of plastics.", "694": "Rising energy services demand is common in each scenario, but how this translates into overall energy and emissions trends is subject to the technologies deployed and innovation unlocked in each outlook.", "695": "A range of technology mixes can meet needs for heating, cooling or mobility, each with distinctive implications for cost, resource use and pollution.", "696": "We explore various pathways in this chapter, examining how decisions to invest in different technologies and resources could meet the world\u2019s

2023, largely in the form of modern bioenergy, solar thermal and geothermal energy.", "732": "These direct uses rise modestly in the STEPS, but they gain ground more rapidly in the APS and NZE Scenario in large part due to increased use of biofuels in transport, which provide an important decarbonisation pathway in sectors such as shipping and aviation where electrification is a less cost competitive solution.", "733": "The use of modern bioenergy in residential buildings also increases in tandem with faster progress to provide universal access to clean cooking.", "734": "Total final

despite economic growth and improved energy access, it rises only modestly to 2030 and then falls slightly between 2030 and 2050.", "737": "In the NZE Scenario, even faster electrification and energy efficiency improvements mean that energy consumption declines by 2030 and falls significantly further by 2050.", "738": "By 2035, total final consumption increases by nearly 55 EJ in the STEPS, bringing it to almost 500 EJ.", "739": "This increase takes place solely in emerging market and developing economies.", "740": "In advanced economies, most increased consumption this decade comes from the industry sector, but this is offset by declines in other sectors, notably transport, where rising mobility needs are more than cancelled out by the use of more efficient energy carriers such as electricity these trends lead to further declines after 2030.", "741": "In emerging market and developing economies, industry is the leading growth sector, contributing nearly 20 EJ of additional demand by 2030, but buildings and transport play increasingly important roles in the longer term as ownership levels of appliances and vehicles rise.", "742": "Car ownership is currently five times higher in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing economies: this ratio falls to four times by 2035 and just over three times by 2050 as the global car fleet expands to 1,6 billion

the mid 2020s and fall much further by 2050.", "748": "In the NZE Scenario, emissions from end use sectors fall more rapidly to around 1 Gt CO2 in 2050: much of these remaining emissions come from

consumption overtaking that of fossil fuels by the early 2040s in the APS, and more than five years earlier in the NZE Scenario.", "753": "The move away from fossil fuels is mainly driven by electrification of end uses, in parallel with increasing decarbonisation of power generation, with the share of electricity in total consumption rising from 20% in 2023 to over 30% in 2050 in the

differs by sector.", "756": "Energy use in 2030 varies the most across scenarios in the buildings sector, with a rise of around 8 EJ from 2023 in the STEPS contrasted with a 4 EJ drop in the APS and a 22 EJ drop in the NZE Scenario.", "757": "These variations are largely driven by more rapid gains in access to modern, efficient energy largely for cooking in developing economies in the APS and particularly in the NZE Scenario, and by varied speeds in the rollout of mature low emissions technologies in other end uses.", "758": "Industry sees the smallest variations, with light industry increasing mainly through the electrification of lowand mediumtemperature heat.", "759": "In the transport sector, variations in the pace of electrification of road vehicles and fuel economy improvements slow the rate of demand growth by 2030 in the APS and stimulate a sharp fall in the NZE Scenario, even as road activity increases by around 15% by 2030.", "760": "After 2030,

65% by 2030 in the STEPS.", "763": "Most of the increase comes from cooking as traditional use of biomass declines, especially in the NZE Scenario.", "764": "Light industry sees faster electrification than heavy industry, which remains reliant on fossil fuels for hightemperature processes, with the result that the electricity share of total consumption in heavy industry remains below 15% until 2050

current policy settings.", "766": "The market share of electric mediumand heavy freight trucks is also projected to increase, albeit more slowly, reaching around 12% in 2030 in the STEPS.", "767": "By contrast, relatively little progress is made in non road transport sub sectors such as aviation and shipping, where the potential for electrification is restricted by technical and cost limitations.", "768": "In 2023, energy demand in the transport sector increased by close to 4%, which is similar to the rate seen in 2022.", "769": "Much of this stemmed from increased aviation activity, which rebounded to over 90% of pre pandemic 2019 levels.", "770": "Road transport also contributed significantly to the increase, up about 2%, reflecting an expansion of the passenger car fleet by over 20 million vehicles, mostly in China, India and Southeast Asia, reflecting rising incomes and population growth.", "771": "By the end of this decade, energy demand in the transport sector increases by nearly 10% in the STEPS .", "772": "Road transport is the primary contributor, followed by aviation.", "773": "Even though the car fleet expands by over 10%, energy use in road transport rises around 5%, reflecting energy efficiency gains and the uptake of EVs.", "774": "In 2023, 12% of all new cars sold worldwide were battery electric, almost 10% were internal combustion engine hybrids, and

promising option to alleviate range anxiety for both cars and trucks.", "787": "By 2030, oil demand in the transport sector in the STEPS remains at current levels despite an increase in passenger activity of more than 30% and of nearly 15% in freight activity.", "788": "EVs are largely responsible for this change, as their dissemination shifts an increasing share of energy demand in transport from oil to electricity.", "789": "The share of road transport activity accounted for by EVs rises from 4% today to around 17% in 2030 in the STEPS, around 20% in the APS, and nearly 30% in the NZE

electric bikes , is gaining traction, especially in urban areas .", "792": "Public transportation continues to play a crucial role, with the world\u2019s bus fleet increasing by over 15% by 2030 and urban rail activity rising 25% by then .", "793": "Electrification and energy efficiency are the key pillars to decarbonise road transport.", "794": "It also plays a central part to decarbonise rail transport, with 75% of rail activity electrified by 2030 in the STEPS.", "795": "Low emissions fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen also contribute to decarbonisation, particularly in non road modes of transport such as aviation and shipping.", "796": "In aviation, sustainable aviation fuels have a pivotal role to reduce emissions, meeting 2% of energy demand for aviation by 2030 and over 10% in 2050 in the STEPS.", "797": "In the APS this rises to 5%, and in the NZE Scenario to over 10% of aviation energy demand by 2030, slightly increasing overall aviation costs .", "798": "In shipping, International Maritime Organization  targets for decarbonisation play a central part in ammonia and hydrogen taking a 4% share of shipping energy demand by 2030 in the APS, with low emissions methanol accounting for another 8% and bioenergy for a further 10%.", "799": "The reduction in global oil demand in road transport also contributes to lower emissions from shipping by decreasing oil shipments.", "800": "By 2030, lower global oil demand in the APS reduces energy demand from international oil tankers by 15%.", "801": "Low emissions fuel consumption in the transport sector is set to rise by 30% in 2030 and to more than double by 2050 from current levels in the STEPS .", "802": "Bioenergy plays a significant role in this, particularly in shipping and aviation.", "803": "In the APS, low emissions fuels help avoid 550 million tonnes of carbon dioxide  emissions in road transport by 2030, and additional bioenergy is used in subsequent years to meet announced pledges, mostly in aviation and shipping.", "804": "Hydrogen and hydrogen based fuels see substantial growth as they become more cost competitive in this scenario, with levels of use rising from 7 petajoules  today to 900 PJ in 2030 and 13 500 PJ in 2050: most of the hydrogen is used for road transport, and all of the ammonia is used in shipping.", "805": "While low emissions fuels are crucial to decarbonise challenging sectors like aviation and shipping, energy efficiency improvements remain vital, and they result in 2 100 PJ of avoided demand by 2030 in the STEPS and 2 600 PJ in the APS in non road

2030 and a 20% share by 2035.", "808": "The FuelEU Maritime Regulation meanwhile targets a reduction of 80% in the emissions intensity of fuel used in shipping in the European Union by 2050, while intergovernmental policies such as the IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index, the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and the Carbon Intensity Indicator are also set to drive significant efficiency improvements in shipping.", "809": "Energy demand in the buildings sector declined by 0,7% in 2023.", "810": "After a decade when annual growth averaged over 1%, the recent fall was primarily due to a warmer winter leading to less demand for space heating, which outweighed increased demand in other end uses.", "811": "Natural gas use fell the most in 2023, dropping by over 4%, which added to the cut in demand seen in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.", "812": "Use of other fossil fuels in the buildings sector also declined in 2023.", "813": "By contrast, electricity use continued to rise with its share of buildings sector demand at 37% in 2023, up from 31% in 2010, underpinned by expanding use in appliances.", "814": "This decade, energy demand growth in the buildings sector slows slightly to under 1% annually in the STEPS to reach 132 EJ in 2030 .", "815": "This modest deceleration continues after 2030, with annual growth averaging 0,7% from 2030 to 2050, when energy

EJ by 2030.", "818": "These varied outcomes are primarily shaped by the pace of advances in access to modern energy, with the faster shift away from highly inefficient traditional use of biomass to clean cooking in the APS and the NZE Scenario which bring substantial energy savings as well as social benefits .", "819": "The wide variation across scenarios also reflects the different pace at which mature technologies are rolled out for other end uses, with faster progress in the APS and NZE Scenario underpinned by higher levels of policy support.", "820": "Electricity use in the buildings sector rises significantly both as a share of energy consumed and in absolute terms.", "821": "In the STEPS, electricity increases to over 40% of energy consumed in buildings in 2030 and over 50% in

other appliances rises more moderately but from a higher base, increasing by 11 EJ by 2050 in emerging market and developing economies.", "840": "While partly due to population growth, the biggest driver is economic growth leading to higher appliance ownership.", "841": "In lower middle income countries, such as India and Indonesia, current ownership rates are often around a third of those in advanced economies, and their rapid economic growth is set to reduce this gap significantly by mid century.", "842": "Conversely, in upper middle income countries, such as China and Brazil, ownership

conditioners.", "856": "While such standards are already widespread \u2013 covering around 90% of global energy consumption from space cooling \u2013 many of these measures are in their infancy and set requirements that fall far short of current potential.", "857": "On a life cycle basis, efficient air conditioners cost no more than less efficient options, and in some countries they cost less.", "858": "The APS reflects commitments from countries to raise energy performance standards over time to garner this cost effective potential.", "859": "Even in the APS, residential cooling demand in emerging market and developing economies triples from 2,6 EJ to 7,7 EJ by 2050.", "860": "Among countries that have established net zero emissions targets, pledges to cut cooling emissions by 2030 have so far focussed on appliance efficiency.", "861": "Few countries have set goals to improve building envelopes this decade, and less than half of new construction in emerging market and developing

mature.", "883": "Yet, many technologies are now advancing beyond the prototype stage: most of them use CCUS and electrolytic hydrogen, but some involve direct electrification, for example, electric steam crackers.", "884": "Direct electrification is more straightforward for non energy intensive industries: around half of the thermal energy that they require is used at less than 100 degrees Celsius  and can be supplied at competitive prices by heat pumps, which can also be competitive at higher temperatures .", "885": "Resistance heating, bioenergy or low emissions hydrogen are alternative solutions: their growing use plays a major part in reducing unabated fossil fuel use to 20% by 2050 in the APS and phasing it out almost completely in the NZE Scenario.", "886": "Current

at least around 25 years, so changing technologies is a slow process.", "889": "For example, while additions of conventional capacity without abatement potential end in the NZE Scenario by 2030, slow turnover of the stock of older capacity means that it takes until after 2040 for most of the stock to be using innovative technologies.", "890": "Investment certainty is needed to enable near zero emissions technology projects to go ahead.", "891": "Some countries are moving in that direction: for example, Germany launched first carbon contracts for difference auctions in 2024 to reduce price

supporting the adoption of EVs drive 40% of the additional electricity demand until 2035 in the STEPS .", "912": "Heat pumps, appliances and air conditioning units also help drive up demand, as do the burgeoning power demands of artificial intelligence and data centres.", "913": "Much of the additional demand projected in the APS comes from the industrial sector, where an increasing number of demonstration projects use electricity in energy intensive industries while at the same time the electrification of light industries proceeds more rapidly than in the STEPS.", "914": "In emerging market and developing economies, the building sector contributes the majority of additional growth by 2035.", "915": "Increasing ownership of appliances and rising demand for air conditioning also make major contributions to rising demand, together with the electrification of industrial production, especially in China.", "916": "In the APS, more stringent minimum energy performance standards

uses the most electricity in both the STEPS and APS, with the industry sector in second place.", "918": "In the NZE Scenario, however, industry becomes the largest sectoral user of electricity by late 2020s as a result of the rapid electrification of light industries and the use of electricity in onsite hydrogen production for steel and chemicals.", "919": "Rising EV sales are responsible for over 20% of total electricity demand growth by 2050 in the STEPS, and for an even higher proportion in the APS and NZE Scenario.", "920": "Hydrogen production via electrolysis also increases electricity demand by 7 000 TWh in the APS by 2050, or about 25% of current total electricity demand, and by 12 000 TWh in the NZE Scenario: this accounts by itself for 20% of the increase in the APS, and 30% in the NZE Scenario.", "921": "In 2023, fossil fuels provided 60% of global electricity supply \u2014 their lowest share of the total in the past 50 years.", "922": "Coal accounted for the largest share

generation nearly triples from 2023 to 2030, accounting for over 90% of electricity supply growth and overtaking coal, which peaks around 2025 and then starts a steady decline .", "927": "By 2035, solar PV and wind provide over 40% of electricity generation, a level that few countries have managed to date.", "928": "Increased use of solar and wind on this scale requires action to modernise grids and expand power system flexibility, including through the development of multiple forms of energy storage .", "929": "Hydropower output depends on precipitation and air temperatures and therefore varies from year to year, but the overall trend is one of slow growth.", "930": "Nuclear power also steadily increases at the global level, while natural gas fired power reaches a peak in the late 2020s before stabilising at around the current level. More ambitious scenarios rely heavily on renewables to accelerate transitions.", "931": "In the APS, the expansion of wind and solar PV is faster than in the STEPS and is complemented by stronger growth of other renewables and nuclear power: this drives down unabated coalfired power by almost 60% by 2035 and cuts natural gas use by 20%.", "932": "In the NZE Scenario, additional renewables, further nuclear power, and the development and deployment of carbon capture technologies and low emissions hydrogen fully decarbonise the electricity sector by 2040: unabated coal is fully phased out

statelevel renewable portfolio standards in the United States.", "939": "Korea and India aim to more than double and Indonesia aims to more than triple the role of renewables by 2030.", "940": "A second key policy priority for many governments is the need to reduce or phase out the use of unabated coal fired power generation.", "941": "This reflects a recognition that the transition away from unabated coal is critical to any clean energy transition.", "942": "Currently more than 95% of electricity generated from coal plants is covered by phase out commitments or net zero emissions pledges.", "943": "However, while many countries have net zero emissions targets, countries responsible for just 10% of electricity generation from coal have national plans in place to phase out the unabated use of coal.", "944": "Although countries responsible for a further 20% have agreed internationally to phase out unabated coal or not to develop new unabated coal fired power, there is a

renewables generation for hydrogen production accounts for more than 10% of global electricity generation in APS by 2050 and 15% in NZE.", "1301": "Global hydrogen and hydrogen based fuel trade increases in 2050 to almost 60 million tonnes of hydrogen equivalent  in the APS and almost 75 Mt H2 eq in the NZE Scenario, representing around 20% of overall low emissions hydrogen demand in both scenarios.", "1302": "This requires the development of extensive infrastructure for the storage and transport of both hydrogen and ammonia, even though some elements of the existing infrastructure for fossil fuels could be utilised.", "1303": "Carbon capture, utilisation and storage  is currently applied at around 45 facilities worldwide with a capture capacity of roughly 50 Mt CO2 per year.", "1304": "While expansion of operational capacity has been slow in recent years, announced projects indicate potential strong growth on the horizon.", "1305": "Realisation of all the projects announced worldwide, which could be completed by 2030, would total 435 Mt CO2 of capture capacity and around 615 Mt CO2 of storage capacity per year.", "1306": "However, this is far from assured as only 20% of the announced capture capacity and 15% of the announced storage capacity have reached a final investment decision or are already in operation .", "1307": "For the next decade, the list of announced projects falls short of what is needed to capture 1,3 Gt CO2 globally by 2035 in line with the APS, and still further below the 2,5 Gt CO2 required in the NZE .", "1308": "To get closer to NDC and net zero emissions targets, new projects are needed to reduce emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants and in hard toabate industrial processes.", "1309": "In both the APS and NZE Scenario, CCUS technology is also employed to produce low emissions hydrogen from natural gas, accounting for 10 15% of total emissions captured annually by 2050.", "1310": "The use of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal increases especially in the NZE Scenario, to reach 1,2 Gt CO2 by 2050, or a fifth of all captured emissions.", "1311": "In the power sector, carbon capture technologies offer the ability to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from coal fired power plants, which emitted 11,3 Gt CO2 in 2023, or almost 30% of global energy related CO2 emissions.", "1312": "With around 9 000 coal fired units in operation today, many of which have potentially long lifetimes ahead, CCUS could have a role to reduce their emissions to keep climate targets within reach.", "1313": "In the STEPS, carbon capture in the power sector makes limited progress since few projects have reached the stage of final investment decision, and there are few concrete policy targets.", "1314": "In the APS and NZE Scenario, however, carbon capture expands rapidly to 2035 and beyond, to reach around 1 050 Mt CO2 in the APS and 1 300 Mt CO2 in the NZE Scenario by 2050.", "1315": "This supports the emissions reductions for coal plants achieved in these scenarios, along with repurposing them for flexibility, retrofitting them to use low emissions ammonia or retiring them early .", "1316": "In the industry sector, there is currently a large gap between project announcements and the required rates of emissions capture in the APS by 2035.", "1317": "About 4,5 Mt of capture capacity operates in industry today, and a further 39 Mt of planned capacity has progressed to the feasibility study stage or beyond.", "1318": "However, even if all planned capacity were realised, it would fall well short of the 330 Mt CO2/year captured in the APS by 2035, half of which the APS projects to be deployed in the cement sub sector, and much of the rest from the production of chemicals and steel.", "1319": "Due to project announcements and policies such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, the Canadian CCUS Investment Tax Credit, and the EU Emissions Trading System, two thirds of the deployment in 2030 in the APS is in advanced economies.", "1320": "These innovative projects and supporting policies demonstrate the feasibility and improve the competitiveness of carbon capture technologies.", "1321": "Beyond 2030, however, two thirds of CCUS deployment in the industry sector by 2035 is projected to be in emerging market and developing economies, where energy intensive industries are concentrated.", "1322": "The Stated Policies Scenario  is based on analysis of current policy settings and regulations.", "1323": "It aims to provide an understanding of where prevailing regional and global energy trends are leading us.", "1324": "However, the energy sector is influenced by a wide range of factors that make for uncertainty, as discussed in Chapter 2.", "1325": "These factors range from shifting geopolitics to changing policies and customer behaviour, and from fast evolving climate impacts to changing markets and new technologies such as artificial intelligence .", "1326": "In this chapter we explore several key uncertainties, using a set of sensitivity cases to investigate how outputs could diverge from the STEPS trajectory.", "1327": "We focus our analysis of uncertainties on the STEPS because it is the scenario which provides a sense of the prevailing direction of travel for the energy sector.", "1328": "The sensitivity cases do not change the broad policy backdrop that underpins and drives the STEPS, or the economic and demographic assumptions that are reflected in the STEPS.", "1329": "Rather, they assess how varying some of the assumptions about deployment rates in the STEPS might affect the energy demand outlook by fuel, sector and region, focusing in particular on electric vehicles , renewables deployment, the liquefied natural gas  surplus and electricity demand.", "1330": "Each uncertainty is explored through the framework of the Global Energy and Climate  Model, which allows us to quantify impacts, and to combine different impacts to provide a better understanding of a plausible range of outcomes for demand by energy source, type and associated carbon dioxide  emissions.", "1331": "When carrying this out, we consider the implications of each uncertainty for all fuels, including coal and renewables, as well as for CO2 emissions.", "1332": "We focus on their direct impacts and avoid making assumptions about consequential synergistic or counterbalancing effects in other areas of services demand.", "1333": "To isolate the impact of the factors analysed, we have assumed for our sensitivity cases that the price environment is consistent with the trajectories in the STEPS.", "1334": "There are many uncertainties that bear on the energy outlook.", "1335": "Those we have selected are all important in terms of their potential impacts and are currently the subject of much debate.", "1336": "We have chosen not to look at the impacts of specific geopolitical events or changes to trade patterns that could occur, or to make assumptions about specific policy changes, but rather to focus on potential shifts in deployment rates, whatever the cause, with the aim of shedding light on the direction and scale of the impacts they might have.", "1337": "All aspects of energy are subject to a wide range of uncertainties, and so are our scenarios.", "1338": "The uncertainties we explore in detail in this chapter are by no means comprehensive, but they are all important and topical.", "1339": "A central goal of sensitivity analysis is to explore the possible impact of changes to modelling results.", "1340": "The analysis presented in this chapter is intended to provide insight into what those impacts might be, and thus to help improve understanding of the energy system.", "1341": "We focus on four main areas: EVs, renewables deployment, the LNG surplus and electricity demand.", "1342": "The electric vehicle  ", "1343": "market is expanding rapidly, leading to a move away from oil to electricity in road transport.", "1344": "Growth has been especially rapid in recent years: EV sales more than tripled between 2018 and 2023, with China alone accounting for over half of the increase.", "1345": "However, there are uncertainties about the future pace of growth in the EV market.", "1346": "In the STEPS, our projections of EV trends and sales take account of factors such as consumer response, advances in technology and policy support.", "1347": "The sensitivity cases consider some of the uncertainties that could affect these parameters.", "1348": "Our EV category includes plug in hybrid electric vehicles , which have a powertrain that enables use of two energy sources, and we consider the impact of variations in that usage.", "1349": "Renewables account for a growing proportion of electricity generation, and their deployment is set to continue to increase rapidly.", "1350": "Growth is driven primarily by wind and solar photovoltaics , which together increased by 16% year on year in 2023, with over half of that expansion taking place in China.", "1351": "The rapid pace of renewables growth brings both risks and opportunities.", "1352": "Risks could arise from pressures in supply chains or difficulties in permitting, notably for wind opportunities could arise from further large reductions in costs of the kind that have benefited solar PV in the past, which could lead to an acceleration of renewables deployment.", "1353": "In addition, developments such as a switch from oil to gas in power generation in the Middle East, for example, could have knock on implications for the renewables sector.", "1354": "A wave of new LNG export capacity is under construction, which has the potential to create a surplus of supply in global gas markets.", "1355": "Downside pressure on natural gas prices could arise from the additional supply, which could make LNG use more attractive for industry, incentivising coal to gas switching.", "1356": "Lower natural gas prices also reduce the attractiveness to consumers for switching from gas boilers to heat pumps, which could potentially delay the uptake of this more efficient form of heating.", "1357": "The growth in demand for electricity use in data centres and artificial intelligence  has garnered a lot of attention recently.", "1358": "Growth will no doubt continue, but there are uncertainties over its pace, which will be influenced by factors such as market trends, algorithm developments and improvements in the efficiency of hardware and software.", "1359": "Appliances and air conditioners account for a rising proportion of demand in emerging market and developing economies, with increasing levels of ownership reflecting economic growth and a rapidly expanding stock of buildings.", "1360": "This is exemplified by the 5% growth in energy demand for appliances in 2023, with more than half of this growth in China.", "1361": "Appliances tend to be less efficient in emerging market and developing economies than in advanced economies, reflecting in part a strong second hand market and more limited energy efficiency measures.", "1362": "The pace at which the efficiency of appliances improves and the extent to which levels of ownership increase together represent a significant uncertainty in electricity demand projections.", "1363": "Climate change is already leading to an increasing number of extreme weather events.", "1364": "This includes heat waves which increase electricity demand in the short term by driving up immediate cooling needs and in the longer term by pushing up the level of ownership of air conditioners.", "1365": "The extent to which heat waves occur in the years ahead and the way that responses to them affect electricity demand is another uncertainty.", "1366": "Each uncertainty has an impact across more than one fuel type, reflecting the interconnected nature of the energy system.", "1367": "Most of the uncertainties we explore touch on the generation and/or demand of electricity.", "1368": "A variety of fuels contribute to power generation, and changes that affect one of these fuels have implications for others in the mix.", "1369": "For example, while EVs displace demand for oil, they also increase demand for electricity which could be generated using coal, natural gas, oil or a renewable energy source: the specific mix depends on location and timing.", "1370": "Some of the uncertainties explored do not directly impact electricity demand, but they still have implications for multiple primary energy sources.", "1371": "For example, changes from using coal to natural gas in industry, or from using oil to natural gas for power generation in the Middle East.", "1372": "Here again much depends on location and timing.", "1373": "In the case of electric vehicles, the pace of EV growth in the high demand case is slower, with a delayed rollout mainly in North America and Europe.", "1374": "In the low demand case, EV growth is faster, with enhanced utilization of manufacturing capacity, leading to increased sales primarily in emerging markets and developing economies  outside of China.", "1375": "The impacted fuels are oil, natural gas, electricity, and coal.", "1376": "Regarding PHEV electric mode operation, in the high demand case, there is less use of the electric propulsion mode by PHEVs.", "1377": "In the low demand case, there is more use of the electric propulsion mode by PHEVs.", "1378": "The impacted fuels are oil, natural gas, electricity, and coal.", "1379": "For the pace of renewables deployment, in the high demand case, wind capacity expansion faces difficulties, causing delayed wind deployment.", "1380": "In the low demand case, solar PV growth is faster, with solar PV capacity expansion exceeding expectations.", "1381": "The impacted fuels are natural gas, electricity, and coal.", "1382": "For Middle East power generation, in the high demand case, there is a delay in the shift from oil fired power generation to gas.", "1383": "In the low demand case, there is a faster transition from oil to gas in power generation.", "1384": "The impacted fuels are oil and natural gas.", "1385": "For coal

impacted fuels are natural gas and coal.", "1387": "Regarding heat pump uptake, in the high demand case, there is slower growth of heat pump installation.", "1388": "The European Union and China take up some of the LNG oversupply, leading to lower rates of heat pump installation.", "1389": "The impacted fuels are natural gas and electricity.", "1390": "For data centers/AI, in the high demand case,

heat waves, in the high demand case, more frequent, intense, and longer duration heat waves drive up ownership of cooling and air conditioning systems, especially in EMDE.", "1397": "In the low demand

sensitivity elements reach almost 5% in 2035 compared to the STEPS, with related impacts on coal that reach 5% of total demand in 2030 before diminishing.", "1401": "Combining all the sensitivity components and interactions into high and low cases indicates that CO2 emissions peak within a few years of the STEPS .", "1402": "In the high case, emissions are 1,6% higher in 2030 and 1% higher in 2035 than in the STEPS.", "1403": "In the low case, emissions are down 1,6% in 2030 and 3,6% in 2035.", "1404": "These variations add up to 5 gigatonnes  to cumulative energy sector emissions over the period to 2035, or reduce them by as much as 7 Gt.", "1405": "Across our sensitivity analysis, overall CO2 emissions are affected less than the demand for each fuel as a result of the balancing effects that take place between fuels when combining sensitivities.", "1406": "For example, while emissions from oil use are reduced in the faster EV growth sensitivity, this is counteracted, albeit to a lesser extent, by slightly higher power sector emissions due to increased electricity demand.", "1407": "The changes from the STEPS presented by the sensitivity analysis here for oil, natural gas and coal are threeto ten times less than those between the STEPS and the Announced Pledges Scenario  in 2030, and sixto thirty times less than those between the STEPS and the Net Zero Emissions by 2050  Scenario for the same year.", "1408": "Oil demand peaks by 2030 in the STEPS after increasing by about 2,6 million barrels per day  from 2023 to 2030.", "1409": "Within this decade, rising sales of EVs and improvements in fuel efficiency lead to petrochemicals taking over from road transport as the main contributor to oil demand growth.", "1410": "The pace of EV sales and the role of PHEVs are two key uncertainties for the oil outlook, and the degree of oil to gas switching in the power sector in countries in the Middle East is a third.", "1411": "Exploring and combining these sensitivities, we find that global oil demand peaks within a few years of that for the STEPS in the high demand case with an additional 1,7 mb/d of oil use, and in the low case with 0,7 mb/d less use of oil .", "1412": "By 2035, oil demand across the sensitivities ranges from 97 mb/d to 102 mb/d.", "1413": "EVs are one of the key factors tempering future oil demand.", "1414": "Annual electric car sales rise from 14 million today to over 40 million in 2030 and nearly 60 million in 2035 in the STEPS.", "1415": "This shift to EVs displaces over 6 mb/d of oil demand by 2030 and 13 mb/d in 2035, with most of the savings deriving from passenger cars.", "1416": "However, the amount of oil displaced depends heavily on how quickly EV sales continue to increase.", "1417": "Electric car sales were up by around 25% year on year in the first half of 2024, with China accounting for about 80% of this increase.", "1418": "Some regions like Asia show robust growth, and North America has seen a rise of nearly 13%.", "1419": "But sales are rising more slowly in other parts of the world for various reasons.", "1420": "For example, some EV subsidies in the European Union have been phased out, and more stringent CO2 emissions standards are not due to take effect until 2025 .", "1421": "A wide range of factors will affect the future rate of EV uptake, including policy support, fuel and emissions standards, the extent to which more affordable EV models become available, the rollout of charging infrastructure, consumer preferences and company strategies.", "1422": "The market share of new electric passenger cars sold in the STEPS reaches about 45% by 2030.", "1423": "In the Slower EV growth case, this figure decreases by close to ten percentage points.", "1424": "In the Faster EV growth case, it increases by close to five percentage points, and the impact becomes more pronounced beyond 2030, particularly in emerging market and developing economies outside China as they significantly expand their car fleets: as a result, the market share of electric cars reaches two thirds by 2035 in the Faster EV growth case, compared with just over 55% in the STEPS during the same period.", "1425": "Certain regions are at higher risk of slowdown in EV sales than others, especially those with strong policies or ambitious goals that may be delayed, cancelled or fail to be met.", "1426": "The risks are particularly acute as markets transition from early adoption of EVs to a phase in which EVs account for the majority of sales.", "1427": "In the United States, for instance, there is uncertainty about the future evolution of greenhouse gas emission standards, and the path that is taken will have significant implications for future EV demand.", "1428": "Any slowdown in the United States, which accounts for about 85% of the entire North American car market, could have ripple effects throughout the region.", "1429": "In the European Union, a review of its CO2 standards in 2026 will assess progress toward achieving 2035 targets, and its outcome is likely to have implications for the speed of EV adoption in EU member countries.", "1430": "Elsewhere, some advanced economies in Asia are facing challenges to increase their EV market share to levels that are comparable to those in other advanced economy markets, while recently announced EV targets in Australia may require additional support measures.", "1431": "Even in China \u2013 the largest EV market \u2013 PHEVs now account for over 30% of total electric car sales, suggesting that consumers still have concerns about range anxiety arising from a perceived lack of adequate charging infrastructure.", "1432": "In this sensitivity case, we assume that these various risks lead to electric car sales being around 10% lower than in the STEPS by 2035.", "1433": "Electric car sales in the United States are close to 10% lower than in the STEPS, and sales in the European Union are 5% lower.", "1434": "Most of the rest of the reduction is in China, where sales are assumed to be around 7% lower than in the STEPS.", "1435": "As a result of these changes, oil demand is around 2 mb/d higher in 2035 than in the STEPS, with the United States and China being key sources of variations .", "1436": "This does not affect the timing of peak oil demand projected in the STEPS: the peak still comes by the end of the decade, but at a level of around 103 mb/d rather than below 102 mb/d as projected in the STEPS.", "1437": "Emerging market and developing economies outside China offer an opportunity to accelerate EV uptake.", "1438": "Spare Chinese EV manufacturing capacity could feed into growing demand in these economies, especially those with established trade routes to China, and they could introduce further domestic measures to support this growth.", "1439": "Car production utilisation rates, encompassing both internal combustion engine  vehicles and EVs, in China are low, at around 50% of total manufacturing capacity.", "1440": "Typical car plants in other regions operate at about 70% capacity on average.", "1441": "While car production utilisation rates in China could exceed 90% for a few large EV manufacturers, there is excess capacity available that could produce 5 million more EVs annually.", "1442": "This could feed demand from emerging market and developing economies as they mature.", "1443": "Plans to scale up domestic EV production in parts of Asia and Latin America could also meet growing demand.", "1444": "In this sensitivity case, we increased global electric car sales by an additional 11 million in 2035, on top of the over 55 million electric car sales that already feature in the STEPS .", "1445": "We assumed that these additional sales would mostly be in emerging market and developing economies outside China.", "1446": "This leads to a reduction in oil demand of 1,8 mb/d in 2035.", "1447": "The reduction does not affect the date when of peak global oil demand is reached in the STEPS: the peak still comes by the end of this decade, albeit at a level approximately 0,3 mb/d lower than in the STEPS.", "1448": "The share of plug in hybrid electric vehicles in total electric car sales has fluctuated between 25% and 40% since 2015.", "1449": "There has been significant recent growth in PHEV sales, particularly in China, where they increased by 80% in 2023 \u2013 a far bigger increase than by battery electric cars, which saw sales rise by over 20%.", "1450": "There are several underlying reasons, the most important of which is that PHEV powertrains largely overcome range anxiety by combining the benefits of both conventional engines and EVs.", "1451": "The trend in China is also attributed in part to the introduction of new PHEV models, given that the market was previously dominated by battery electric models.", "1452": "Despite playing a strong role in the EV mix in the short term, sales of PHEVs are likely to drop rapidly after 2030 as an increasing number of more affordable battery electric models becomes available and as advances in battery technology and the rollout of charging infrastructure alleviate range anxiety.", "1453": "However, the critical factor for PHEVs is how consumers operate them.", "1454": "Studies have shown that electric mode use typically accounts for between 20% and 40% of the annual mileage .", "1455": "Incentives such as access to lowemissions zones for PHEVs operating solely in electric mode, along with government efforts to ensure affordable electricity prices, could boost the use of electric mode in PHEVs.", "1456": "Employing electric mode usage as a factor, we constructed two sensitivity cases with different oil demand trends: a more electric mode operation case which increases the current levels of electric propulsion by over 30 percentage points by 2035, and a less electric mode operation case which holds the proportion of PHEV electric propulsion at current levels.", "1457": "In the case where electric mode use stagnates, PHEVs lead to an increase in oil demand by around 100 thousand barrels per day  by 2035 in the case where electric propulsion increases, oil demand declines by 250 kb/d over the same period.", "1458": "Oil remains an important part of the electricity mix in the Middle East.", "1459": "The region currently consumes around 1,7 mb/d of oil every year in the power sector alone, equivalent to the total oil demand of Indonesia.", "1460": "Around 340 terawatt hours  were generated by oil fired power plants in 2023, providing 25% of total electricity supply in the region.", "1461": "The largest user of oil fired power in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, generating nearly half of the total in 2022: it is home to the world\u2019s largest oil fired plant, which consumes around 200 kb/d on peak days.", "1462": "Other major users of oil fired power are Iran  Kuwait , Iraq , Syria  and Lebanon .", "1463": "There is much uncertainty, however, about the amount of oil that will be used in the electricity sector in the Middle East over the next decade.", "1464": "While electricity demand is projected to rise rapidly, the largest users of oil in power are making efforts to shift away from oil to natural gas and renewable energy sources.", "1465": "For instance, the Vision 2030 programme in Saudi Arabia aims to phase out oil for power generation by 2030, though specific plans to achieve this objective have not yet been established.", "1466": "High dependence on oil in the power sector is a point of concern to many countries in the region, and consideration is being given to how to reduce its use.", "1467": "For example, in Iraq, where there has been recent progress in switching to natural gas and where there are ambitions to increase the availability of natural gas for power through the elimination of flaring before 2030.", "1468": "Taking into consideration these policies and factors, Middle East oil demand in the power sector declines by about 900 kb/d to 2030 in the STEPS, while natural gas demand in the power sector increases by over 40 billion cubic metres  and renewable electricity generation increases sixfold.", "1469": "In a case where transitions away from oil are delayed in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other countries in the region, oil use in the power sector could decline by less than it does in the STEPS, and in consequence oil demand could be some 500 kb/d higher in 2030 than in the STEPS.", "1470": "On the other hand, in a case where transitions away from oil proceed more quickly than in the STEPS, including through more rapid switching to natural gas and renewables, oil use in the power sector could be further reduced by around 250 kb/d in 2030 compared to the STEPS.", "1471": "While global natural gas demand increases by about 250 bcm from 2023 to a peak of 4 400 bcm in the late 2020s in the STEPS, global gas markets remain well supplied.", "1472": "A wave of new LNG supply coming to market, together with other factors, applies downward pressure on the price of LNG exports in the STEPS .", "1473": "The response to these price reductions is uncertain and could lead to global natural gas demand increasing faster than projected in the STEPS in order to clear available supply.", "1474": "We find that the LNG surplus of around 130 bcm in 2030 in the STEPS could lead to higher demand for natural gas, with some of it being used for electricity generation, heating and industry.", "1475": "This would displace the fuels that would otherwise have been used, such as oil in power, coal in industry and electricity in buildings, including heat pumps.", "1476": "In addition, we analyse the implications for natural gas demand related to uncertainties in the pace of renewables deployment and electricity demand growth.", "1477": "Combining these uncertainties, we find that the effects would see a peak within a few years of that for the STEPS , although there are circumstances that could see growth beyond this range .", "1478": "On the other hand, faster solar PV deployment and lower electricity demand growth could see an earlier peak in natural gas demand and a more significant decline to 2030 and 2035.", "1479": "In the STEPS, LNG demand increases by 145 bcm between 2023 and 2030, while export capacity expands by around 270 bcm, loosening global gas markets .", "1480": "This puts downward pressure on natural gas prices, which in the STEPS average around USD 6,5 per million British thermal units  in the European Union in 2030, USD 7/MBtu in China and around USD 8/MBtu in Japan.", "1481": "This is almost half the levels seen in the European Union in 2023, and about 35% lower in China and Japan.", "1482": "Existing LNG export capacity and new capacity under construction is sufficient to meet projected demand in the STEPS until 2040.", "1483": "This suggests that no further projects are required in the near term to satisfy demand for LNG.", "1484": "Compared with previous waves of LNG supply growth, there are now fewer buyers that are obliged to take volumes of gas on long term take or pay contracts.", "1485": "Around one third of the capacity under construction is as yet uncontracted, meaning these additional volumes will be made available on the spot market from suppliers or portfolio players with equity stakes in the terminals.", "1486": "With the increasing liquidity and flexibility of global LNG supply, there is a high degree of uncertainty about which markets and sectors have the capacity to absorb these additional volumes of gas.", "1487": "This is compounded by uncertainties about production: in some cases, this might fall faster than anticipated, for example Bangladesh or Thailand, and in others it might surprise on the upside, for example in China.", "1488": "On the import side, there is significant LNG regasification capacity of around 1 500 bcm today \u2013 more than double the amount of export capacity \u2013 and a further 200 bcm is being built.", "1489": "Around 40% of the new capacity is being built in China.", "1490": "Europe is also increasing its ability to import LNG and by 2030 its regasification capacity is set to reach 370 bcm per year, which is 50% higher than it was before Russia invaded Ukraine.", "1491": "Overall, there are relatively few infrastructure related constraints to increasing LNG use, barring some bottlenecks to reach new centres of gas demand in India.", "1492": "We explored a sensitivity case where the LNG surplus and the resulting downward pressure on prices in the STEPS stimulates additional demand above the level in the STEPS of around 75 bcm by 2030.", "1493": "This additional demand raises overall LNG capacity utilisation from 80% in the STEPS in 2030 to 90%, closer to current levels of around 95%.", "1494": "Most of the incremental volume comes from existing projects in the United States, with the remainder supplied principally by Canada, Qatar and exporters in Nigeria and Mozambique.", "1495": "The upward adjustment to demand pulls forward the date at which new LNG export capacity is needed.", "1496": "Whereas in the STEPS, current projects are able to meet demand to 2040, in this sensitivity case a supply gap opens in the mid 2030s and around 60 bcm of new capacity is required by 2040.", "1497": "There are several potential sources of this incremental supply, but many face challenges.", "1498": "Current projects in East Africa have been delayed by security concerns, while difficulties developing upstream resources have tempered export capacity growth in West Africa and Australia.", "1499": "Russian LNG supply growth is meanwhile hobbled by sanctions, while possible projects in other countries with export ambitions, such as Saudi Arabia, are at a very early stage of development.", "1500": "On the other hand, Qatar and the United States, which dominate today\u2019s pipeline of new projects, look well placed to develop more capacity in the long term.", "1501": "Canada and Argentina are also in a strong position to ramp up gas exports now that they are completing planned infrastructure to transport gas from inland fields to coastal terminals.", "1502": "The power sector is the largest user of natural gas, consuming about 40% of the total in 2023.", "1503": "Any changes in power sector demand for natural gas could therefore have a significant effect on overall natural gas demand.", "1504": "Two of the most important potential changes that could raise natural gas use in the power sector are an acceleration in the pace of electricity demand growth  and delays or reductions in expansion of renewables.", "1505": "We find that changes of this kind, together with increased oil to gas switching in the Middle East, could raise natural gas demand in the power sector by 100 bcm in 2030.", "1506": "The majority of that increase would be in gas importing countries, which together would take up a significant portion of the LNG surplus.", "1507": "In our analysis, the effects are largest in China, the European Union and Southeast Asia, though there are also smaller effects in many other countries .", "1508": "Among exporting countries, these uncertainties would affect natural gas demand in the power sector the most in the United States, followed by countries in the Middle East.", "1509": "There are of course many other uncertainties in the power sector.", "1510": "For example, there could be significant policy changes, such as additional measures in some countries to accelerate transitions away from coal fired power, or a change of position on nuclear power.", "1511": "There could also be more coal to gas switching in the power sector than projected in the STEPS if gas prices were to fall to levels below those projected.", "1512": "However, we have had to be selective in choosing uncertainties for consideration, and these fall outside the scope of this analysis.", "1513": "In the power sector, uncertainties concerning the pace of expansion for wind power are especially relevant for gas demand.", "1514": "In the STEPS, global wind power is projected to increase rapidly and to double by 2030: these projections reflect policy support for wind power in over 60 countries, widespread resource availability and proven low cost technology.", "1515": "The link between wind power and natural gas use in the power sector is particularly important in the European Union and the United States, regions where the wind industry has recently faced challenges, creating some uncertainty about the pace at which deployment is likely to be scaled up in the coming years.", "1516": "The main challenges are from supply chain issues, permitting and licensing hold ups, grid connection queues, and with tightening profit margins due to fixed price contracts and increases in equipment costs.", "1517": "Onshore wind development is most affected by the challenges arising from permitting, licensing and grid queues, and offshore wind by those arising in the supply chain and related financial challenges.", "1518": "A number of US offshore projects were cancelled or delayed in 2023, which are already reflected in the STEPS, but the challenges for offshore wind could last longer than projected.", "1519": "There has also been a reduction in the level of participation in recent wind power auctions in the European Union.", "1520": "Such uncertainties could reduce expansion of wind power to 2035 by almost 20% in the United States, and almost 15% in the European Union, cutting installed wind capacity in 2035 by nearly 80 gigawatts  .", "1521": "The impact of delayed deployment of wind power in the United States would be an extra 23 bcm of natural gas demand in 2030 and over 30 bcm in 2035, while in the European Union it would lead to an extra 7 bcm of gas demand in 2030 and 9 bcm in 2035.", "1522": "The solar industry faces some of the same challenges, including grid connection queues and permitting and licensing problems in some instances, but its supply chains are in a stronger state.", "1523": "Additional growth for electricity demand could also raise the level of natural gas demand in the power sector.", "1524": "In advanced economies, a faster rise in electricity demand that outstripped the growth of renewables would be likely to prompt turning to natural gas to fill the gap.", "1525": "In emerging market and developing economies, where coal is the primary source of electricity, a faster than expected increase in electricity demand would lead to additional use of coal, but it would also mean a search for additional natural gas in many instances, particularly in Southeast Asia.", "1526": "As discussed", "1527": ", the extent of oil to gas switching in the Middle East is another major uncertainty.", "1528": "We have also assessed the potential for a larger response from the industry sector to lower natural gas price resulting from the LNG surplus.", "1529": "Lower prices could lead to faster displacement of coal and oil boilers by natural gas in China, India and Southeast Asia without changing the rate of electrification.", "1530": "In non energy intensive industry, where most of this displacement occurs, the average rate of replacement for natural gas boilers increases to 2,3% per year in the sensitivity case compared with 0,6% in the STEPS by 2030.", "1531": "This results in gas demand increasing by 23 bcm in 2030 compared to the STEPS, displacing 13 million tonnes of coal equivalent  of coal demand and 0,3 mb/d of oil demand.", "1532": "We assume that distribution infrastructure is able to meet this additional demand, though that may be challenging in some cases, notably in India and Southeast Asia.", "1533": "Lower natural gas prices in the years ahead could also lead to larger increases in demand for natural gas for ammonia production as a result of existing coal based production plants in China and Southeast Asia being converted to gas faster than projected in the STEPS, though the effect on gas demand is much smaller than that arising from the displacement of oil and gas boilers in industry.", "1534": "In the sensitivity case, this switch results in additional gas demand of around 3 bcm for ammonia production by 2030, which displaces another 4 Mtce of coal demand.", "1535": "Lower natural gas prices could also have a larger impact on the buildings sector by delaying moves away from gas fired heating to heat pumps.", "1536": "Heat pump growth slowed in 2023 as the market consolidated after a significant surge in 2022 which was probably driven by the energy crisis.", "1537": "Growth is expected to pick up again.", "1538": "The STEPS projects growth in the stock of heat pumps by two thirds by 2030.", "1539": "However, China and the European Union, which account for more than 40% of the current global heat pump stock, remain particularly vulnerable to the risk that the lower gas prices in the STEPS could further slow the pace of gas boiler replacements.", "1540": "In the sensitivity case, heat pump sales could be reduced by 20% in the European Union and China, resulting in a 10% reduction in stock by 2030 compared with the STEPS: this increases gas demand by 14 bcm, displacing 50 TWh of electricity by 2030.", "1541": "Solar PV deployment is a major success story in global clean energy transitions.", "1542": "Installed solar capacity has roughly doubled every three years since 2015, and this increase has been accompanied by similar expansion in solar PV manufacturing capacity.", "1543": "Existing solar PV module manufacturing capacities are more than sufficient to produce over 900 GW of solar PV modules, which is the level of capacity additions required in the NZE Scenario by 2030 announcements of planned new capacity would increase this to almost 1 400 GW, or more than 50% above the NZE Scenario level, assuming that these plans proceed.", "1544": "Existing overcapacity has contributed to a 90% reduction in solar PV costs since 2010, but it has also put at risk the competitiveness of the industry, with the STEPS projecting a utilisation rate for solar module manufacturing of just 50% by 2030.", "1545": "If manufacturing overcapacity persists, there is potential for a larger response to the low solar PV costs projected in the STEPS, with even faster solar PV growth, especially in emerging market and developing economies, despite challenging financing conditions.", "1546": "In this sensitivity case, we assess to what extent such an acceleration might displace fossil fuel power plants, and what the impact of would be.", "1547": "We project that solar PV capacity additions might increase by 60 GW in 2030 compared to the STEPS, which would mean an average 55% utilisation rate for manufacturing capacity.", "1548": "This would reduce natural gas fired power generation by 180 TWh in 2030 and about 330 TWh in 2035, saving close to 40 bcm and almost 70 bcm of natural gas respectively, alongside reductions for coal fired power.", "1549": "In the modelling, two thirds of the reductions in natural gas use by 2035 are in China and Southeast Asia, where solar PV manufacturing capacity is concentrated, and the other third in countries in Africa.", "1550": "Faster solar PV deployment would also cut coal fired power in many regions.", "1551": "The combined effect of these changes would bring an additional 280 million tonnes of carbon dioxide  emissions reductions in 2035 compared with the STEPS.", "1552": "Uncertainties concerning the pace of electricity demand growth could vary the level of natural gas demand in the power sector.", "1553": "Global electricity demand could be reduced by as much as 2%, in turn reducing the global demand for natural gas by around 50 bcm in 2030 .", "1554": "About two thirds of this demand reduction would likely take place in emerging market and developing economies, where the uncertainties for electricity demand growth are largest, and would principally affect India and Southeast Asia, with more modest impacts in the Middle East, Africa and China.", "1555": "While advanced economies are more reliant on gas fired power, the uncertainties they face about electricity demand growth are more circumscribed.", "1556": "The sensitivity case nevertheless sees a decline in demand for natural gas of around 30 bcm compared with the STEPS as a result of uncertainties about the speed of growth in electricity demand for EVs, appliances and data centres.", "1557": "This principally affects the United States, which sees demand fall by almost 17 bcm compared with the STEPS, with most of the rest of the reduction in the European Union.", "1558": "Electricity demand in the STEPS increases at an annual average rate of 3% from 2023 to 2035.", "1559": "Many of the key drivers relate to emerging market and developing economies, where rising populations and incomes result in higher levels of demand as more buildings are constructed and as more people buy and use appliances and air conditioners.", "1560": "Demand for cooling has already led to a rapid rise in the sale and use of air conditioners, which is expected to continue.", "1561": "Heat waves are likely to become more frequent and intense with climate change, increasing both the demand for and costs of cooling .", "1562": "Data centres are another cause of rising electricity demand, linked in part to expanding use of AI.", "1563": "With these drivers in mind, we evaluated key uncertainties related to data centre demand, appliance efficiency and heat waves, together with EV growth .", "1564": "Our sensitivity case finds that, in aggregate, the average annual growth rate from 2023 to 2035 moves up to 3,4% in the high case and down to 2,7% in the low case.", "1565": "While shifts of this size would be important, they would not deflect the continuing and inexorable rise of electricity demand.", "1566": "Meeting higher electricity demand has near term implications in our sensitivity case for both gas fired and coal fired power, particularly the latter, which in the modelling would see demand rise by 4% at the global level in 2030 .", "1567": "In early 2024, over 11 000 data centres were registered worldwide.", "1568": "The number of servers installed increased around 4% per year between 2010 and 2020, but data centre electricity demand broadly plateaued as increasing information technology  demands were mitigated by efficiency improvements in cooling and by workloads moving to larger and more efficient cloud data centres.", "1569": "In recent years, however, electricity consumption has picked up as efficiency improvements have been outpaced by surging demand for data centre services.", "1570": "Data centre electricity consumption was estimated in 2022 to be in the range of 240 to 340 TWh, around 1% to 1,3% of total electricity consumption .", "1571": "Although AI currently accounts for a relatively small share of global data centre electricity consumption, it is emerging as a new driver of growth.", "1572": "Investment in AI and new data centres is booming.", "1573": "The global venture capital sector has invested over USD 225 billion in AI startups over the past five years, compared to USD 143 billion over the same period in startups operating across all aspects of the clean energy sector.", "1574": "Driven in part by data centres and AI, capital spending by US technology giants Alphabet , Meta , Amazon and Microsoft reached around USD 150 billion in 2023, up by more than a factor of two on the 2019 level and equivalent to around 0,5% of US gross domestic product.", "1575": "Interest is not confined to advanced economies, with China, India and other emerging market and developing economies also seeing robust growth in data centres.", "1576": "A substantial increase in electricity consumption from data centres appears inevitable .", "1577": "However, several factors make projections challenging.", "1578": "First, the supply chain is highly concentrated around a few bottlenecks, particularly for the chips that handle AI and other compute intensive workloads.", "1579": "Taiwan Semiconductor, which holds more than a 90% share of the market for AI related chips, has announced investments to meet expected demand for their most advanced chips, and plans to open new factories in 2026, but it is currently limited to existing infrastructure.", "1580": "Average lead times for new chip fabrication plants are 3 5 years.", "1581": "Second, efficiency gains are hard to model.", "1582": "They have recently been substantial: NVIDIA's Blackwell Platform cut energy consumption by around 75% compared to the previous generation of graphics processing unit  chips.", "1583": "In addition, there is potential for algorithmic optimisation to reduce future computational load.", "1584": "However, more efficient chips may also increase demand due to the rebound effect, and energy efficiency improvements appear unlikely to fully offset the growing service demands due in part to AI.", "1585": "Third, any or all of the electricity network, generation capacity and permitting processes may constrain the rate of data centre expansion.", "1586": "There are also policy related uncertainties.", "1587": "On one hand, governments have enacted industrial and localisation policies to support development of domestic value chains for chips and data centres.", "1588": "On the other hand, trade restrictions on key physical components, for example certain chips and chip tools, at the global level, or data centre construction limits at the local level, could slow developments.", "1589": "Furthermore, data availability presents substantial challenges for analysts to assess the outlook for data centre electricity demand, in contrast to other more traditional parts of the energy system, where data collection processes are more standardised.", "1590": "The evolution of demand for data centres and AI services is thus highly uncertain.", "1591": "Major investment in AI startups and computing resources are being made, but the nature, speed and scale of end use adoption is still unclear.", "1592": "For these reasons, projections should be made with caution, using a scenario based approach and putting results in the context of", "1593": "the broader energy sector Total electricity demand across all sectors is set to increase by around 6 760 TWh by 2030 in the STEPS, equivalent to more than the electricity demand of the European Union and the United States combined in 2023.", "1594": "The main drivers of this increase are the electrification of transport, industrial processes and space heating, and rising demand for appliances and cooling equipment.", "1595": "In the STEPS, about 80% of additional electricity demand for 2023 2030 is in emerging market and developing economies.", "1596": "Data centre demand grows strongly but provides a relatively small contribution to overall electricity demand growth .", "1597": "Driven by the rising demand for both AI and more conventional data centre services, global server capacity is expected to more than double by 2030.", "1598": "After a decade of substantial technical efficiency improvements and on the back of an increase in more energy intensive data centre workloads, notably for AI, the rate of technical efficiency gains is expected to flatten  .", "1599": "Consequently, global data centre electricity demand is anticipated to increase significantly by the end of this decade, with the scale dependent on technological advances in IT equipment and hardware deployment.", "1600": "In the base case, data centres account for less than 10% of total electricity demand growth at the global level, which is roughly on a par with demand growth for desalination, and less than a third of the demand growth for both EVs and space cooling in the buildings sector.", "1601": "Therefore, growth of electricity demand for data centres is projected to be rapid, but the level looks set to remain relatively small in the context of overall global demand growth.", "1602": "Nevertheless, data centre operators are now among the most active clean electricity purchasers as clean electricity supply becomes central to their sustainability strategies .", "1603": "The top ten corporate buyers of clean energy power purchase agreements  in 2023 included Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft.", "1604": "Between 2023 and 2030, total data centre demand growth is projected to be just below 50% of the annual global increase in low emissions sources of electricity over the last five years, so meeting this demand growth sustainably is feasible.", "1605": "However, data centres are very spatially concentrated, and constraints on generation and grid capacity may be more severe at the local level .", "1606": "The clustering of data centres is driven by the benefits of proximity to infrastructure such as fibre optic cables and power resources to customers, particularly those with a need for nearreal time access to data, like financial services companies and to existing business ecosystems and talent pools.", "1607": "Location decisions are also driven by incentives and regulation, and by climatic considerations: cooler places have lower cooling needs.", "1608": "Spatial concentration is already creating tensions, with several jurisdictions issuing moratoria on further data centre development or taking steps to restrict it.", "1609": "Overall, significant electricity demand increase from data centres is inevitable, but the extent of growth is uncertain.", "1610": "In any likely scenario, however, data centres look set to remain a relatively small driver of overall electricity demand growth at the global level in the decade to come.", "1611": "Nonetheless, constraints at the local level may be significant.", "1612": "To ensure that the outlook for data centre demand growth is better understood and that actual growth is met sustainably, policy makers, the energy industry and the technology sector need to work more closely together to enhance data sharing, strengthen regulatory dialogue, improve efficiencies, scale up low emissions electricity supply and mitigate local bottlenecks.", "1613": "Global temperatures are rising as the climate changes, and 2023 was the warmest year on record.", "1614": "In addition to climatological shifts and their impact on the average global surface temperature, there has been an increased prevalence of extreme temperatures in the form of more intense, frequent and persistent heat waves, some of which have led to notable temperature records.", "1615": "Recent examples include highs of almost 50 degrees Celsius  over three days in western Canada , highs exceeding 40 \u00b0C in the United Kingdom , and extended heat waves over much of India during May/June 2024 and parts of China in August 2024.", "1616": "One consequence of more intense, frequent and longer heat waves is expected to be an increase in ownership of air conditioners.", "1617": "Consumers buy units to stay cool in high temperatures and to be prepared for expected future heatwaves.", "1618": "For example, heat waves in India during 2024 are understood to have prompted a doubling of air conditioner sales.", "1619": "As conditions get hotter, air conditioners are used more often, and they also have to work harder to keep buildings and people cool.", "1620": "Space cooling is already one of the fastest growing sources of electricity demand and it plays a significant role in increasing the level of peak demand for electricity .", "1621": "The combination of increased use and ownership is cumulative and accelerates electricity demand growth.", "1622": "The energy demand curve also shifts with higher peak consumption levels that could jeopardise system security.", "1623": "For the sensitivity case, we considered a world where more frequent, more intense and longer heat waves mean that levels of cooling demand in aggregate are higher than in the STEPS.", "1624": "It concentrates on what cooling from high temperatures would mean for electricity demand.", "1625": "We assessed heat waves by considering the historic distribution of cooling degree days and assuming more periods in the higher, hotter end of the spread.", "1626": "In addition, we factored in an accelerated pace of air conditioner ownership acquisition.", "1627": "The results indicate that electricity demand would be around 500 TWh higher in 2030 in this sensitivity case, compared to the STEPS, and almost 700 TWh higher in 2035, which is around 20% of total cooling demand in the buildings sector in that year in the STEPS .", "1628": "More than 80% of the electricity demand increase compared to the STEPS occurs in emerging market and developing economies, notably India, China and Southeast Asia, due to their climate and their relatively low air conditioner ownership rates, and cooling demand increases by an average of 25% compared to the STEPS.", "1629": "In advanced economies, cooling demand increases by just over 10% since air conditioner ownership is already near saturation levels in regions in which it is needed.", "1630": "We find that average air conditioner ownership rates would be 16% higher in 2035, a level not seen until after 2040 in the STEPS, which drives 70% of the demand increase.", "1631": "In most regions, this demand increase has to be met by additional dispatchable generation because cooling demand is concentrated in a few months of the year.", "1632": "Since this type of generation is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, gas and coal consumption would each increase by 2% by 2030, resulting in 270 Mt of additional CO2 emissions.", "1633": "Acquisition and use of an expanding array of electrical appliances and cooling equipment is a key driver of rising electricity consumption in fast growing emerging market and developing economies in the STEPS .", "1634": "Energy consumption in the buildings sector from space cooling and appliances is set to increase in the STEPS by 35% to 2030 and 60% by 2035.", "1635": "This is primarily driven by growth in population and floorspace, increased ownership of appliances and improved living standards.", "1636": "Energy efficiency improvements, supported by strong policy measures, can help to moderate this growth which is reflected in the STEPS.", "1637": "Rates of efficiency improvements, however, have varied widely in the past across emerging market and developing economies as a result of differing policies and standards together with uneven implementation, and the scope for efficiency improvements is at risk of being severely curtailed by the continued sale of obsolete and inefficient air conditioners and other appliances in some emerging market and developing economies.", "1638": "Without appropriate standards, regulation and effective enforcement, consumers could be locked into old, inefficient technologies for many years.", "1639": "The difficulty of assessing the scale of future energy efficiency improvements against this background creates potential uncertainties for the STEPS projections which we have analysed in the following cases.", "1640": "Markets with strong minimum energy performance standards  only cover a limited share of global demand for cooling appliances.", "1641": "This provides incentives for appliance manufacturers to maintain distinct product ranges for those countries with MEPS and those without, or to specialise in less efficient products with cheaper upfront costs.", "1642": "Our high demand case assumes that, for the end uses considered, weak or delayed efficiency policies reduce the rate of efficiency improvement by one third.", "1643": "The effect of this is to increase electricity demand in the buildings sector in emerging market and developing economies by 170 TWh by 2030 and 340 TWh by 2035, compared to the STEPS, which is equivalent to 3% to 5% of cooling and appliances demand.", "1644": "The impact is amplified over time by economic growth and increased appliance ownership.", "1645": "There are wide regional disparities, with India seeing the largest impact from poor air conditioner efficiency at about 30% of the total increase in electricity demand .", "1646": "In the low demand case, the number of markets with strong MEPS expands to reach critical mass, so that international companies choose to comply with standards across all their global operations in order to avoid the costs of maintaining separate product ranges for markets with MEPS and those without, and manufacturers specialising in inefficient goods are gradually squeezed out.", "1647": "As a result, more efficient appliances are rolled out worldwide.", "1648": "Our low demand case assumes that widespread MEPS and efficiency labelling lead to efficiency levels equivalent to those in the APS.", "1649": "This results in electricity demand 400 TWh lower in 2030 than in the STEPS, and almost 900 TWh lower by 2035, equating to 13% of cooling and appliances demand in the buildings sector.", "1650": "Highly efficient standards benefit China the most, due to its economic development and high growth in ownership rates, and it accounts for almost 45% of the demand reduction.", "1651": "Meeting higher or lower electricity demand growth than projected in the STEPS has implications for the supply of electricity that vary by region related to the available fleet of power plants.", "1652": "The operations of existing power plants could be varied in many cases to meet higher or lower electricity demand, though new construction could be needed to meet higher electricity demand that persists, while lower demand could lead to earlier retirements of some power plants.", "1653": "In the short term, faster electricity demand growth would be met largely by operating existing power plants more often, in particular coaland natural gas fired power plants.", "1654": "In advanced economies, this would generally mean higher levels of natural gas fired power.", "1655": "In some cases, higher demand may also require new power capacity to ensure that peak demand can be met.", "1656": "In the STEPS, the average capacity factor of natural gas fired power plants in advanced economies declines from 36% in 2023 to 31% in 2030 and 26% in 2035.", "1657": "If they had to meet the higher demand seen in the sensitivity case, the average capacity factor for gas fired power plants would still decline over time, but it would do so at a slower rate.", "1658": "In emerging market and developing economies, the large fleet of coal fired power plants is capable of significantly increasing output to meet higher levels of demand.", "1659": "However, even with the additional electricity demand growth explored here, the average capacity factor of coal fired power in emerging market and developing economies still declines from 2023 to 2030, even though coal fired power generation is 4% higher in 2030 than in the STEPS.", "1660": "In the longer term, new renewables capacity could be built by the late 2020s and early 2030s to meet nearly 85% of higher electricity demand.", "1661": "As solar PV and wind are already the cheapest new sources of electricity in most regions today, it is likely that they would be deployed to meet persistently higher levels of electricity demand, thus mitigating the additional total output from coaland natural gas fired power plants .", "1662": "Lower growth in electricity demand would drive faster reductions of fossil fuels to 2030 and beyond.", "1663": "Natural gas fired power in 2030 is 4% lower in this sensitivity case than in the STEPS, and coal fired power is 4,5% lower, while oil use in the power sector is largely unchanged.", "1664": "Collectively, the changes in fossil fuel fired power would reduce CO2 emissions by 520 Mt in 2030.", "1665": "Renewables, nuclear power and other low emissions sources are largely unchanged by lower electricity demand growth.", "1666": "Many countries have targets to increase installed capacity or the low emissions share of generation based on specific electricity demand expectations.", "1667": "Where electricity demand growth turns out to be lower, we project that most of those countries are likely to choose to overshoot their share targets rather than to seek to slow deployment of renewables.", "1668": "Each of our scenarios has different implications for security, affordability and sustainability.", "1669": "These are the elements examined in detail in this chapter.", "1670": "The three objectives are rarely in perfect alignment, and policy makers often face choices and trade offs between them.", "1671": "But neither are they necessarily in opposition to one another and there are many policy choices that can simultaneously attain all three.", "1672": "What can be said with some confidence is that the way policies are designed is key to striking a balance between these objectives.", "1673": "Energy security is the focus of the first part of this chapter.", "1674": "Energy security means having uninterrupted energy available at an affordable price.", "1675": "That in turn means ensuring reliable sources of supply and designing and maintaining infrastructure and systems that are resilient against physical and cyber threats.", "1676": "Alongside traditional risks to fuel security, issues could arise during energy transitions, not least in the power sector, given increasing electricity demand and a shift to more variable generation, and in clean energy supply chains, given concerns about market concentration and an excessive reliance on a small number of suppliers.", "1677": "Each scenario has some distinctive risks.", "1678": "The trajectories that we map may in some ways understate the difficulties that lie ahead.", "1679": "Our scenarios depict smooth, orderly processes, in which markets, investment, technologies and policies evolve in a consistent way.", "1680": "This is not how the energy system operates in practice.", "1681": "The future is likely to be characterised by competing interests, market imbalances, stop and go policies and bouts of volatility and turbulence, just as the past has been.", "1682": "People centred aspects of energy transitions are the focus in the second section.", "1683": "Public acceptance is a critical factor for the pace and consistency of energy transitions.", "1684": "In this context, the impact of transitions on energy affordability, on jobs and livelihoods, and on the ability to access energy services is particularly important.", "1685": "This section provides an overview of how energy transitions are affecting people, and how they are affected by people\u2019s choices.", "1686": "It covers energy access and affordability, energy employment and changing consumer behaviours, highlighting how these people centred aspects look today, and how they could evolve in the years ahead.", "1687": "Efforts to tackle climate change is the focus of the third section.", "1688": "It details emissions of carbon dioxide  and methane associated with each scenario and looks at the extent to which they could exacerbate climate change.", "1689": "In addition to the implications of each scenario for the rise in global average temperatures, it considers the substantial variations in outcomes for air quality and the consequent effects on public health.", "1690": "The indispensable role of investment in safeguarding all the elements discussed in earlier sections wraps up this chapter.", "1691": "It examines recent trends in capital flows to the energy sector, looks at sources of investment and financing, and assesses their adequacy in relation to the requirements of the scenarios.", "1692": "Energy security is a \u201cfoundational and central mission\u201d for the International Energy Agency , in the words of the communiqu\u00e9 adopted by ministers at the IEA 50th anniversary meeting in 2024.", "1693": "The concept of energy security has evolved over the years since the IEA was created in response to the first oil shock in the 1970s.", "1694": "Assessing energy security now requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only traditional risks but also risks that could emerge because of the impacts of climate change and the momentum behind clean energy transitions.", "1695": "The IEA response to recent turbulence in energy markets provides an illustration of the multiple issues in play.", "1696": "In 2022, following Russia\u2019s full scale invasion of Ukraine, the IEA undertook the two largest ever co ordinated emergency oil stock releases in its history to help prevent shortfalls in global supplies.", "1697": "At the same time, within days of the Russian invasion, the IEA released a ten point plan showing how the European Union could rapidly reduce its reliance on natural gas supplies from Russia, including by accelerating deployment of clean energy technologies.", "1698": "Although the crisis had a very specific cause, it highlighted the general risk of excessive reliance on a single source of energy from a single producer, and the benefits that diversity can bring for energy security.", "1699": "With this principle in mind, the IEA has also been paying close attention to the resilience and diversity of clean energy supply chains, including security risks affecting the supply of critical minerals that are essential for many clean energy technologies.", "1700": "Traditional risks to oil and gas security show few signs of abating and continue to be a central preoccupation for the IEA, even as these risks evolve during energy transitions.", "1701": "As the world moves towards a more renewables rich energy system, some aspects of energy security will improve, but new hazards are also emerging.", "1702": "For example, a more digitalised and electrified world means that cybersecurity and electricity security have become critical concerns for policy makers around the world.", "1703": "Lasting energy security is not just about increasing the supply of power and fuels, and ensuring that adequate and resilient infrastructure and systems are in place.", "1704": "It is also about using energy more efficiently.", "1705": "Better materials and insulation, newer technologies and more efficient appliances significantly reduce the energy needed to heat, cool and light our homes and workplaces.", "1706": "In addition, it is about minimising CO2 and methane emissions.", "1707": "It is sometimes claimed that policy makers need to choose between energy security and climate action.", "1708": "There are indeed some potential trade offs, which we discuss in this section.", "1709": "But failure to act on emissions increases the risks to energy security, not least because the physical consequences of a changing climate pose a threat to the reliability of the global energy infrastructure and trade flows.", "1710": "A comprehensive approach to energy security needs to include major reductions in the energy related emissions that are creating risks to energy supplies, as well as efforts to make energy systems more climate resilient.", "1711": "The position of oil and natural gas markets today is very different from just a few years ago.", "1712": "Before the Covid 19 pandemic, global spare crude oil production capacity, excluding Iran and Russia, averaged less than 3 million barrels per day  today it stands at close to 6 mb/d.", "1713": "During the global energy crisis, after gas exports to Europe from Russia were cut, natural gas markets were so tight that a 2022 explosion and fire at a liquefied natural gas  terminal in Texas with 20 billion cubic metres  capacity, close to 20% of US LNG capacity, caused wholesale natural gas prices to jump in much of Europe by more than 10% and in the United Kingdom by more than 20%.", "1714": "Although the European natural gas market remains fragile, markets are now less tight, around 270 bcm of new LNG capacity is set to become available in the next few years, increasing global available liquefaction capacity by close to 50% by 2030 .", "1715": "Previous editions of the World Energy Outlook  warned of a risk of underinvestment in oil and natural gas in a Stated Policies Scenario like trajectory for demand, noting a gap between the amounts being invested in oil and gas and the future requirements of this scenario.", "1716": "This risk appears to have receded.", "1717": "Oil and gas investment has risen by around 30% since 2021, while estimates of future investment have come down as projected oil and gas demand levels have moderated.", "1718": "However, there is no room for complacency: unexpected outages or other events could drastically change the supply demand balance.", "1719": "In the Stated Policies Scenario  ", "1720": "in this WEO, oil and natural gas demand both peak before 2030 and decline slowly thereafter.", "1721": "Investment in both new and existing fields is needed in the STEPS to avoid volatile markets and prices, but the level of investment in oil and gas supply in 2024  is around 20% more than what is invested in 2035 in this scenario.", "1722": "Increases in oil production in a number of non OPEC producers, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Guyana, push the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  share of the market down to around 33% in 2030, a level not seen since the late 1980s.", "1723": "After 2030, the OPEC share of the oil market starts to rise again.", "1724": "In the Announced Pledges Scenario  and Net Zero Emissions by 2050  Scenario", "1725": ", oil and natural gas demand peak earlier and then fall at a much faster rate.", "1726": "Investment in oil and gas in the APS in 2035 amounts to some USD 490 billion, which is around 40% lower than today, and in the NZE Scenario it is USD 250 billion, which is 70% lower.", "1727": "In these scenarios, many new projects face major commercial risks, and some may fail to recover their upfront costs.", "1728": "If all LNG projects under construction are developed, the global average utilisation rates of LNG plants would fall from around 95% of capacity today to 75% by 2035 in the APS and to less than 45% in the NZE Scenario, much lower than the 90% utilisation rate in the STEPS.", "1729": "There is sometimes a debate about whether the emphasis should be placed on demand side or supply side actions in pushing forwards towards net zero emissions.", "1730": "In practice, rapid and sustained progress towards net zero emissions depends on tackling both supply and demand in an integrated way.", "1731": "In the APS and the NZE Scenario, reductions in fossil fuel investment are synchronised with reductions in demand, notably through efficiency gains, and with rapid scaling up of investment in clean energy.", "1732": "This approach offers the prospect of rapid progress while minimising price volatility and security risks.", "1733": "For example, the nearly 75% reduction in investment in fossil fuel production in the NZE Scenario between 2023 and 2035 is only consistent with maintaining reliable energy supplies on the assumption of a 2,5 fold increase in clean energy investment over the same period .", "1734": "This scenario requires policies that focus both on scaling up the supply and demand of clean energy and on scaling back the supply and demand of fossil fuels.", "1735": "Policies and measures focussing on reducing fossil fuel demand and supply play a particularly important role in ensuring that the energy transition is achieved in a just, orderly and equitable way.", "1736": "Examples include policies that focus on the early retirement or conversion of fossil fuel assets, such as coal fired power plants or long lived industrial facilities, or that focus on providing clear signals to markets about the desired direction of travel, such as bans on the sale of fossil fuel equipment.", "1737": "Inclusive dialogue between industry, labour, communities and governments \u2013 including between producer and consumer countries \u2013 are also essential to help inform coherent energy investment planning and to maximise opportunities for socio economic development from the transition.", "1738": "Supply focussed fossil fuel policies include those that reduce the emissions intensity of oil and gas supply or put in place arrangements for the safe and responsible decommissioning of fossil fuel infrastructure when it is no longer needed.", "1739": "These policies also have a part to play in avoiding the unplanned, chaotic or premature retirement of existing fossil fuel infrastructure where this could have negative consequences for the reliability of the overall system.", "1740": "Ample spare crude oil capacity and the upcoming wave of new LNG supplies provide buffers against the risk of sharp price shocks, but the security of fuel supplies is far from guaranteed, not least because the effectiveness of this capacity to address any shortfalls that may arise hinges on the ability of alternative sources of supply to reach an affected country or region quickly.", "1741": "Without both resilient and reliable sources of energy and infrastructure to transport supply to customers, local or regional disruptions remain a distinct possibility in the face of risks from geopolitical tensions, technical failures and extreme weather events.", "1742": "These impacts are likely to be felt more acutely in import dependent countries.", "1743": "For example, for importers in Asia \u2013 including Japan, Korea, and developing Asia \u2013 oil and gas import dependency increases in aggregate in all scenarios, while the share of oil and gas in total energy demand falls.", "1744": "In the STEPS, oil import dependency for these countries rises from 80% today to close to 90% in 2050, and gas import dependency increases from 40% today to 60% by 2050 .", "1745": "Petrochemical demand in Asia as a whole is one of the key drivers of oil demand and imports .", "1746": "The Middle East is the world\u2019s largest oil exporter today and this remains the case in all scenarios.", "1747": "It is also responsible for around one third of the increase in LNG supplies in the STEPS to 2035.", "1748": "The Middle East Asia route is therefore set to remain an essential artery for seaborne trade in oil and gas.", "1749": "As a result, consumers in Asia are exposed to the risk that geopolitical events in the Middle East or accidents near major trade chokepoints could lead to physical shortages of supply, as well as price volatility.", "1750": "Key maritime trade routes remain vital to the well being of global oil and gas markets, but they depend on safe passage through places such as the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca.", "1751": "Today some 80% of crude oil imported into East Asian countries passes through the Strait of Malacca, and more than half of it flows through the Strait of Hormuz.", "1752": "The Strait of Malacca is mounting in importance, and oil and gas volumes flowing through it are set to increase from 24 mb/d and 70 bcm today to 28 mb/d and 140 bcm in 2050 in the STEPS, cementing its position as the largest chokepoint for global oil and LNG trade .", "1753": "The complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz, while unlikely, would block off around 20 mb/d of crude oil and oil products, or around 20% of global oil supply, together with the vast majority of OPEC spare production capacity.", "1754": "Around 20% of global LNG trade also flows through the Strait of Hormuz, and any action that blocked this would similarly be highly damaging for natural gas markets.", "1755": "For producer economies, energy transitions create a powerful incentive to accelerate the pace of economic and energy sector reforms while at the same time reducing a major source of revenue that could finance these reforms.", "1756": "Just ten established producer economies in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America currently produce more than 30 mb/d of oil and nearly 800 bcm of natural gas annually, and their income from oil and gas sales in 2035 falls by 30% in the APS and by 70% in the NZE Scenario from the average annual level seen between 2010 and 2023.", "1757": "The consequences of reductions in oil and gas revenue of the kind seen in these scenarios would fall most heavily on producers, but they could affect consumers as well.", "1758": "If a major producer were to struggle to withstand the strains placed on its fiscal balances, there is a risk that this might at some point affect its political and economic stability, which could in turn disrupt supplies and lead to higher and more volatile prices globally.", "1759": "The downward spiral in Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector in recent years illustrates that this is more than a theoretical possibility.", "1760": "The Middle East, a major fuel supplier to the global market, is particularly vulnerable to climate events, underscoring its need for more climate resilient energy infrastructure .", "1761": "However, the increase in frequency and severity of climate hazards such as floods, cyclones, droughts and extreme heat waves pose serious risks to energy infrastructure and threaten reliable energy supplies in all parts of the world.", "1762": "For example, Hurricane Ida temporarily disrupted 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States in 2021 and shut down many oil refining and petrochemical facilities for weeks.", "1763": "In the same year, exceptionally cold weather in Texas shut down some natural gas and power supplies, causing blackouts and hardship for consumers.", "1764": "There are also increasing risks from violent storms that could impact LNG plants and refineries, which are often located in coastal areas, and from water shortages in dry regions, which can disrupt fuel supply operations.", "1765": "Efforts to reduce unabated fossil fuel use and scale up clean energy need to be carefully designed, which means, among other things, trying to map interdependencies and anticipate possible feedback effects.", "1766": "For example, a mismatch between the rate of expansion of lowemissions electricity generation, networks and electrified end user equipment on the one hand and the decommissioning of natural gas fired plants and gas networks on the other could lead to energy security risks.", "1767": "It could also disproportionately affect consumers that are unable to make the higher upfront investment often needed for electric end use equipment.", "1768": "Some existing infrastructure has a potentially important role to play in accelerating the development of low emissions fuels.", "1769": "Some of these fuels, including biomethane, lowemissions hydrogen based fuels and some liquid biofuels, can make use of existing infrastructure and end use equipment.", "1770": "Delivery costs for others, including hydrogen, would be much lower if the existing infrastructure were to be adapted specifically for their use.", "1771": "Such adaptation could help a number of countries that have the potential to be major producers to export these fuels and could similarly help countries with limited domestic resources to import them, and thus reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports, diversify their energy mix and reduce their emissions.", "1772": "The scale up of low emissions hydrogen in the NZE Scenario offers an illustrative example.", "1773": "In this scenario, around 400 million tonnes  of low emissions hydrogen equivalent are consumed globally in 2050.", "1774": "Around 20% of this is traded internationally, including hydrogen converted into low emissions hydrogen based fuels.", "1775": "Low emissions hydrogen is expensive to transport, and repurposing existing pipelines could reduce investment costs by 50 80% .", "1776": "Even if pipelines are repurposed in this way, new dedicated hydrogen transport infrastructure is still needed.", "1777": "There are currently plans to develop around 37 000 kilometres  of hydrogen pipelines globally by 2035, which is broadly in line with what is needed in the NZE Scenario.", "1778": "However, most of these projects are at an early stage and only a handful have reached final investment decisions, reflecting the generally slow pace of market development.", "1779": "It is more challenging to convert existing storage for use with hydrogen, and new facilities will be required, including depleted gas fields, hard rock caverns, salt caverns and aquifers.", "1780": "Overall investment in hydrogen storage is currently very low and announced projects cover only a small fraction of the needs in the NZE Scenario .", "1781": "Adequacy and flexibility are both critical to the stability of electricity systems.", "1782": "Adequacy focusses on ensuring that there is enough capacity and supply to meet peak demand, while flexibility relates to the ability to handle variations in demand and renewable energy supply and to maintain a continuous balance between electricity demand and supply.", "1783": "Ensuring that electricity supply and demand are always in balance also requires secure and resilient electricity networks.", "1784": "Electricity demand increases in all regions and scenarios over the next ten years and changing patterns of consumption have a significant impact on peak levels of demand.", "1785": "Anticipating peak demand growth and mitigating it where possible is key to ensuring electricity security.", "1786": "In the STEPS, peak demand rises by almost 15% in advanced economies to 2035, mainly because more consumers use electric heating and electric vehicles , and by up to 80% in emerging market and developing economies, most of which reflects increasing use of air conditioners and other forms of space cooling.", "1787": "In the APS, peak demand grows by a similar amount to the STEPS, as more electrification is compensated by higher energy efficiency gains and stronger deployment of demand side flexibility measures.", "1788": "Energy efficiency measures can significantly reduce peak electricity demand.", "1789": "Minimum energy performance standards for appliances, especially those used for cooling, improved buildings insulation and more efficient industrial motors all serve to reduce total and peak electricity demand.", "1790": "Demand side flexibility measures can also bolster adequacy.", "1791": "In the STEPS, efficiency and demand side flexibility measures mean that peak demand rises by less than 15% to 2035 in advanced economies: without these measures, peak demand would increase by more than 40% .", "1792": "In the APS, the widespread deployment of smart meters, dynamic tariffs and demand response enabled appliances keeps peak demand in 2035 15% below the level it would otherwise reach in advanced economies.", "1793": "Peak demand is similarly reduced by improved efficiency and demand side flexibility in China and other emerging market and developing economies, with efficiency gains playing an especially big role .", "1794": "There are other strategies to mitigate the rise in peak demand.", "1795": "These include increasing the capacity and number of interconnections, reinforcing existing grid infrastructure, developing new grid lines and protecting them from cyberattacks and climate related damage.", "1796": "In addition to helping with the management of peak demand, these measures help reduce the need to expand fossil fuel dispatchable power plants to provide system adequacy.", "1797": "Nonetheless, the scale of the increases in peak electricity demand seen in all regions in both the STEPS and APS means that new dispatchable capacity is required.", "1798": "Battery storage is the fastest growing source of short term dispatchable capacity to 2035 across all scenarios.", "1799": "In advanced economies, almost 600 gigawatts  of batteries are added in the STEPS to 2035, and more than 850 GW are added in the APS some new natural gas power plants are also built in both scenarios, primarily to replace existing capacity.", "1800": "A large amount of battery capacity is added in emerging market and developing economies, but gasand coal fired power plants also continue to play an important role in these economies.", "1801": "Globally in the STEPS, batteries provide 55% of new dispatchable capacity, new natural gas power plants provide 20% and new coal power plants add a further 10% to 2035 .", "1802": "Around 50% of these coal capacity additions are in China, 20% in India and almost 10% in Indonesia more than 50% of the total are already under construction or in the pipeline.", "1803": "In the APS, there is an even larger role for batteries, which provide more than half of dispatchable capacity, and 500 MW of coal capacity additions are equipped with carbon capture, utilisation and storage. There", "1804": "is also an important role for new nuclear plants, which provide 6% of the additional capacity that becomes available in the STEPS: the majority of which is in emerging market and developing economies, with 40% of it in China.", "1805": "In advanced economies, extending the life of existing reactors where feasible remains the most economical way to maintain a stable nuclear fleet that contributes to a secure and affordable supply of electricity.", "1806": "Flexibility needs over both short term and seasonal timeframes vary widely across regions, largely due to differences in the share of renewables and in electrification rates.", "1807": "In most markets, dispatchable thermal and hydropower, including pumped storage, provided nearly all short term and seasonal power system flexibility in 2023, but this is set to change.", "1808": "Short term electricity flexibility needs, measured here as the largest hour to hour changes in residual load , rise sharply in the STEPS over the next ten years in many parts of the world, including Europe, China, India and United States .", "1809": "In the period to 2050, they increase in these countries by threeto seven times more than total electricity demand, due mostly to rising shares of solar PV and wind and, to a lesser degree, evolving patterns of electricity demand.", "1810": "For example, short term flexibility needs in Europe increase from 30 GW in 2023 to 170 GW to 2050 while average electricity demand increases from 360 GW to 610 GW.", "1811": "Seasonal flexibility needs, measured as the highs and lows of residual load across the year, are driven primarily by electricity demand patterns, though the seasonality of renewable supply, notably wind and solar PV, also play a part.", "1812": "In Europe, seasonality is a feature of power systems today, mostly due to high heating demand in winter, and seasonal flexibility needs increase 50% faster than average electricity demand growth to 2035 in the STEPS as heating is increasingly electrified.", "1813": "In India, seasonal flexibility needs increase 30% faster than average electricity demand growth during the same period, where electricity demand almost doubles.", "1814": "Seasonal flexibility needs in India increase from a lower level than in Europe today, primarily due to strong demand growth for cooling.", "1815": "In China, seasonal flexibility needs increase 40% faster than average electricity demand growth to 2035 in the STEPS.", "1816": "In the United States, seasonal flexibility needs move broadly in line with increases in electricity demand.", "1817": "In the APS, more renewables and faster electrification increase the need for shortterm flexibility in all regions.", "1818": "Higher energy efficiency can temper the growth in the APS for the needs for seasonal flexibility.", "1819": "Batteries and demand side response are set to provide the majority of short term power system flexibility in both the STEPS and APS after 2035.", "1820": "Batteries provide short term flexibility for periods of one to eight hours, helping to improve grid stability and enabling the rapid growth of solar PV by allowing electricity generated during the day to meet demand at other times.", "1821": "In both the STEPS and APS, they provide around 30% of short term flexibility needs in 2035 and around 40% in 2050.", "1822": "Demand side response also makes a major contribution to flexibility even when it affects a relatively small fraction of overall demand .", "1823": "The role of thermal power plants to provide short term flexibility in power systems evolves over time.", "1824": "Their share of the power mix declines but as short term flexibility needs increase, they are called on to adjust their output more often and over a wider range.", "1825": "Downward ramping is needed during hours with high renewables output, for example in the middle of the day when solar PV production is at its peak, and upward ramping is needed when residual demand increases rapidly, for example at the end of the day when solar output declines.", "1826": "In the STEPS, gas fired power plants in Europe in 2050 operate below a 25% capacity factor for most of the year, but they operate above 60% three times as often as they do today .", "1827": "This more responsive operating mode will require upgrades to the existing dispatchable thermal fleet and measures to ensure that flexibility services are sufficiently incentivised to ensure their economic viability .", "1828": "Seasonal flexibility needs are mostly provided by hydropower and thermal power plants to 2035.", "1829": "In the STEPS, these power sources cover 90% of seasonal needs in 2035 and 75% in 2050.", "1830": "The curtailment of some renewables output can also be part of a cost effective approach to handle seasonal variability in power systems, and when planned for, can also help to reduce investment in other infrastructure such as electricity grids, storage and electrolysers.", "1831": "There is scope for electrolysers to contribute in the future to seasonal flexibility by using excess renewables generation to produce hydrogen that can be stored in long duration storage facilities.", "1832": "Weather patterns can vary significantly from year to year, influencing electricity demand through temperatures, and solar PV, wind generation and hydropower availability.", "1833": "Depending on the climate, this can lead to variations in seasonal flexibility needs, affect power plant operations and increase the variability of power system costs .", "1834": "Expansion of manufacturing capacities for many clean energy technologies has far exceeded the increase in clean energy technology deployment, contributing to the large drop in clean energy technology prices in recent years.", "1835": "For example, annual capacity additions of solar PV increased roughly fourfold between 2018 and 2023 from 100 GW to more than 420 GW while annual manufacturing capacity expanded by a factor of six from around 200 GW to 1 150 GW.", "1836": "Existing manufacturing capacity for solar PV modules and cells is almost sufficient to achieve what is necessary to meet demand in the NZE Scenario in 2030, with only modest gaps remaining for wafer and polysilicon manufacturing.", "1837": "For lithium ion batteries, existing manufacturing capacities and projects that have reached final investment decision are within reach of the deployment needs in 2030 in the NZE Scenario, if fully utilised, even without other early stage projects that are in the pipeline.", "1838": "For wind, existing capacity and announced projects would deliver just over 60% of 2030 deployment levels in the NZE Scenario .", "1839": "Manufacturing capacities are highly concentrated geographically.", "1840": "Owing to its supportive industrial policies, China has a very large proportion of existing manufacturing capacity for solar PV, wind, heat pumps, electrolysers and battery components.", "1841": "In the case of batteries, for example, China holds almost 90% of global capacity for battery cathode active materials, often a combination of lithium with nickel, cobalt and manganese, or iron phosphate, and 98% of capacity for battery anode active materials, frequently graphite or silicon doped graphite.", "1842": "While the project pipeline is expanding rapidly worldwide, a large portion of planned projects are being developed in the regions where most capacity is already located, with China accounting for around 90% of announced capacity additions for both cathodes and anode active materials by 2030 .", "1843": "The overall level of geographic concentration in manufacturing is therefore set to remain high, even if all announced projects come to fruition.", "1844": "The situation is somewhat different for battery cell manufacturing.", "1845": "The share of existing manufacturing capacity in China is slightly lower than is the case for cathodes and anodes, and planned capacity additions in Europe and the United States means this is likely to fall further.", "1846": "In the European Union and the United States, announced battery cell manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet the 2030 domestic deployment needs associated with their climate goals, provided that planned projects come online as scheduled .", "1847": "There are several barriers that hinder investment in new clean energy manufacturing capacities outside China, the chief of which is a large production cost gap.", "1848": "IEA analysis of more than 750 manufacturing facilities indicates that the capital and financing costs incurred in building a clean energy manufacturing plant in the United States and Europe are typically 70 130% higher per unit of output capacity than those in China .", "1849": "Energy, material, labour, and fixed operational expenditure can comprise 70 98% of the total costs of building and operating solar PV, wind and battery manufacturing plants, and lower operational costs in China amplify the cost differentials with advanced economies .", "1850": "Financial incentives for manufacturing to help reduce these cost gaps are often provided in the form of capital expenditure support, such as investment tax credits, grants, concessional loans and loan guarantees, or operating cost support, such as production tax credits.", "1851": "However, the challenges of investing in new manufacturing facilities are not limited to cost.", "1852": "The size of the domestic market and its political stability, workforce, infrastructure readiness, permitting processes, regulatory regimes and environmental, social and governance  requirements all affect corporate investment decisions.", "1853": "Policy interventions can help raise the attractiveness of investing by providing a high degree of policy stability, compressing project lead times, strengthening training and certification schemes for workers, enlarging domestic markets, reducing regulatory uncertainties and mandating higher ESG standards.", "1854": "Measures to support innovation, including R&D grants and support for rapid prototyping, can also make a difference.", "1855": "Critical mineral markets were turbulent in 2023, with a sharp drop in the price of many materials.", "1856": "These lower prices have helped to bring about lower clean technology costs, including a 14% reduction in battery pack costs in 2023 but they are now dampening the investment appetite for new resource developments, with implications for future supply diversification .", "1857": "In the case of nickel, for example, three quarters of operating or potential projects that are at risk in today\u2019s price environment are outside the top three producing countries.", "1858": "If they close because of low prices, supply will become further concentrated among the largest suppliers.", "1859": "A number of projects to develop new critical mineral mines and refineries have been announced in recent years, but growth in the availability of critical minerals from the pipeline of announced projects \u2013 many of which have significant lead times \u2013 is set to be slower than expected growth in manufacturing capacity for a number of critical minerals.", "1860": "For example, in the APS in 2035, for copper and lithium, there is a sizeable gap between demand and expected supply based on announced projects .", "1861": "Balances for nickel and cobalt also look tight in terms of confirmed projects, but the outlook is better if projects at earlier stages of development are included .", "1862": "These results should not be interpreted to mean that energy transition goals are unattainable due to material constraints.", "1863": "The gaps between future demand and anticipated supply could be closed by developing additional mining and refining projects, more diversified technology choices such as for battery chemistries or grid networks, promoting innovation, such as more efficient battery pack design, and boosting recycling .", "1864": "They do however highlight risks to energy security based on current critical minerals investment and technology trends.", "1865": "Further risks arise from the high degree of concentration of supplies of many critical minerals within a few countries.", "1866": "Based on the pipeline of announced projects, this looks unlikely to change over the next decade.", "1867": "From 2023 to 2035, some 50 75% of supply growth for refined copper, lithium, and cobalt is projected to come from today\u2019s largest producers, and the same is true for about 90% of battery grade graphite supply and nickel growth.", "1868": "The figures for rare earth elements are lower, but these too face very high levels of market concentration .", "1869": "There are challenges in financing new critical mineral supply chains, including cost inflation, long term price uncertainty and the limited value that consumers currently place on diversification.", "1870": "However, there is plenty of scope for demand side actions such as recycling, innovation and behavioural change, for example right sizing EV batteries, to play a role to ease potential supply strains.", "1871": "In the NZE Scenario, for example, demand for copper increases by 50% to 2040 but primary supply rises only by 30% because of increased recycling.", "1872": "Incentivising products which score highly on ESG criteria can also help diversify supply sources, but standards and regulatory interventions are likely to be needed to encourage the widespread use of sustainably and responsibly produced materials.", "1873": "Subsidies or tax credits are another option for supporting the production of responsibly sourced materials, for example by linking eligibility to the procurement of a certain percentage of material supply from responsibly and sustainably produced materials.", "1874": "Carbon accounting frameworks and carbon pricing schemes could also help drive pricing differentiation between various sources of materials, and disclosure policies such as those included in the European Union Battery Regulation could make it easier for purchasers and consumers to determine the emissions of different material sources.", "1875": "The 2022 global energy crisis provided a stark reminder of how much societies depend on reliable and affordable supplies of energy.", "1876": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine led to a huge increase in wholesale energy prices, prompting governments worldwide to spend USD 940 billion to support their populations by keeping energy more affordable.", "1877": "These interventions helped limit the cost pass through to retail energy prices but were insufficient to safeguard households entirely, particularly those with low incomes.", "1878": "Worldwide, consumers spent on average 20% more on energy in 2022 than in 2021, with the rising cost of energy outpacing increases in disposable income over the same period.", "1879": "The situation began to improve in 2023, with declining wholesale energy prices, but the rollback of consumer affordability support measures meant end user energy prices remained relatively high in some regions.", "1880": "In advanced economies, the poorest 10% of households can spend up to a quarter of their disposable income on residential energy and transport fuels, even though they consume about half as much of these fuels as the richest 10%.", "1881": "This level of expenditure means that some households face difficult choices between heating or cooling their homes and meeting other basic necessities.", "1882": "In 2022, almost one in ten people in the European Union \u2013 more than 40 million people \u2013 were unable to keep their homes adequately warm .", "1883": "In emerging market and developing economies, modern energy use by households is on average only one third of that in advanced economies: the richest 10% of households in emerging market and developing economies today consume about as much energy as the poorest 10% in advanced economies.", "1884": "The disparities between income groups in emerging market and developing economies is also wider than in advanced economies .", "1885": "In these economies, the poorest consume around one quarter of the energy consumed by the richest.", "1886": "They are also heavily dependent on the traditional use of biomass, which meets one third of residential energy demand and is not included in expenditure metrics.", "1887": "Total household spendings on energy, including residential energy and transport fuels, currently averages nearly USD 4 000 per year in advanced economies and around USD 700 per year in emerging market and developing economies.", "1888": "In the NZE Scenario, households in advanced economies soon start to see lower energy bills than in the STEPS thanks to investment in improved insulation, more efficient heating and cooling systems, behaviour changes and wholesale fossil fuel prices that have been driven lower by reduced demand.", "1889": "Public support for household investment in clean energy equipment also reduces direct household energy expenditure in the NZE Scenario.", "1890": "These savings also far outweigh the increased cost borne by consumers in adopting higher efficiency and fuel switching measures.", "1891": "In emerging market and developing economies, household energy expenditure is initially higher in the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS as a result of increased access to modern energy, reductions in fossil fuel subsidies and the introduction of CO2 pricing.", "1892": "Household energy expenditure in the NZE Scenario nevertheless is around 25% lower than in the STEPS by 2050 .", "1893": "Many clean energy technologies are already the most affordable options when life cycle costs are considered.", "1894": "While their upfront costs in many cases are higher than those of their conventional equivalents, they often have much lower operating costs because they are more efficient.", "1895": "They also shield consumers from volatility in fossil fuel prices.", "1896": "However, the higher upfront costs of many clean technologies compared with their conventional counterparts is a significant barrier for lowand middle income households.", "1897": "Addressing this issue is crucial because the energy transition cannot succeed if the poorest segments of the population are left behind.", "1898": "Potential measures include targeted subsidies for efficiency upgrades and fuel switching, tax rebates and lowor zero interest loans.", "1899": "Ensuring that these households have access to affordable financing is especially important in emerging market and developing economies where higher interest rates exacerbate the financial burden of technologies with high capital costs.", "1900": "An inequality that is sometimes given insufficient weight in today\u2019s energy system is the disparity between urban and rural households.", "1901": "Rural houses are often more isolated and more expensive to connect to energy networks, and so they often face higher energy prices, despite efforts by many governments to regulate electricity and natural gas prices so that they are broadly the same for households in rural and urban areas.", "1902": "In advanced economies, rural households spend around one third more on energy than their urban counterparts, and this expenditure represents a larger portion of their total expenditure.", "1903": "Several factors contribute: rural households tend to be larger and less efficient than those in urban areas, which drives up heating and cooling bills they spend more on transport fuels because they have to travel further to get to work and to access essential services  and have less access to public transport and so tend to own and use personal vehicles more frequently.", "1904": "In emerging market and developing economies outside China, average energy bills for rural households are almost half the average level of urban households, yet they account for a very similar share of their total expenditure.", "1905": "Rural households tend to have more limited access to modern energy services and so rely more on the traditional use of biomass.", "1906": "They also tend to have lower incomes, lower levels of ownership of energy consuming equipment, and less access to developed transport infrastructure.", "1907": "In China, rural and urban households on average spend similar amounts on energy, though rural households devote a somewhat larger share of their budget on it.", "1908": "As in advanced economies, rural households in China primarily use modern energy sources and tend to be larger and less efficient than urban ones.", "1909": "However, lower levels of ownership of energyconsuming equipment limit their total energy expenditure.", "1910": "Because rural households in advanced economies tend to spend more on energy than urban ones, they could potentially benefit more than urban households from the lower operating costs of clean energy technologies.", "1911": "For example, the average payback period for an electric car for rural households in advanced economies is under five years, compared with above six years for urban households, and the average payback period for heat pumps is 13 years for rural households, compared with ten years for urban ones .", "1912": "The availability of public charging stations in rural areas remains a major hurdle, especially in regions where long distance driving is common.", "1913": "The clean energy technology proposition is less clear cut in emerging market and developing economies, where access gaps and lower disposable income lead to much lower levels of energy consumption in rural households.", "1914": "Increasing clean energy investment has led to a steady increase in the number of people working in the energy sector.", "1915": "In 2023, more than 67 million people were employed in the energy industry worldwide, 4% more than in 2022, with most of the growth coming from clean energy industries .", "1916": "In a number of major economies, clean energy has been a prominent driver for new economy wide employment, for example contributing as much as 10% of overall job growth in China in 2023.", "1917": "A few key technologies are responsible for most of the new jobs.", "1918": "EV manufacturing and their batteries saw some of the biggest gains in employment: 0,4 million jobs were added in 2023, raising the global total to 2,7 million.", "1919": "Nearly three quarters of the global EV and EV battery workforce in 2023 was located in China, with employers benefitting from new energy vehicle manufacturing incentives from the government.", "1920": "About one fifth of the global EV and battery workforce was in the United States and the European Union, which both have large existing vehicle manufacturing capacities and have recently implemented policies that aim to boost domestic EV manufacturing.", "1921": "Solar PV and wind energy also saw substantial employment growth in 2023: they now account for a combined 6,2 million workers worldwide, most of which work in construction and installation.", "1922": "The share of clean energy in economy wide employment growth in most emerging market and developing economies outside China has been more muted than in advanced economies.", "1923": "This is partly because the non energy economy of these countries has been growing rapidly, but also because they have seen much lower levels of clean energy investment than advanced economies and China.", "1924": "The largest share of clean energy jobs today is in the construction and installation of new energy projects, followed by jobs in operation.", "1925": "But in emerging market and developing economies, these roles tend to pay less than comparable jobs in advanced economies, even when adjusted for purchasing power parity.", "1926": "Lower labour costs in emerging market and developing economies should be an advantage to attract new clean energy industries.", "1927": "However, most new clean technology manufacturing facilities to date have been concentrated in China, advanced economies and Southeast Asia.", "1928": "Growth in clean energy manufacturing employment has been particularly slow in Africa and Central and South America.", "1929": "This may reflect concerns on the part of prospective investors about relatively small domestic and regional markets for deployment, ample global manufacturing capacity for many clean technologies, and a relative absence of relevant adjacent industries and skills that are often a strong draw for clean energy manufacturers siting new facilities.", "1930": "In the STEPS, more than 6 million new energy workers are needed worldwide by 2030.", "1931": "This figure rises to 15 million in the NZE Scenario.", "1932": "EVs and EV batteries see the largest gains to 2030, with the number of jobs in the STEPS increasing from 2,7 million today to 6,7 million in 2030.", "1933": "In the NZE Scenario, this rises to 10,5 million .", "1934": "Job losses are associated with declining production and consumption of fossil fuels in each scenario.", "1935": "The global coal mining workforce has been shrinking for more than a decade, led by the push to modernise the mining industry in China, and this is set to continue in the years ahead.", "1936": "By 2030, the number of coal supply jobs worldwide falls by over 20% in the STEPS and by 50% in the NZE Scenario.", "1937": "The number of oil and natural gas supply jobs rises by almost 300 000 in the STEPS but falls by nearly 5 million jobs in the NZE Scenario to 2030.", "1938": "Many oil and gas companies, especially in advanced economies, are turning to contract work to manage short term increases in worker demand while adopting strategies of portfolio diversification and upskilling to hedge against uncertainty in future demand.", "1939": "The impact of these losses on individuals and communities can be huge.", "1940": "In some cases, workers may be able to find alternative work in other energy sectors.", "1941": "But even those workers that are best placed to make this switch, such as highly skilled oil and gas workers, face challenges: new jobs may not be located in or near the places where they currently work or offer the same benefits and remuneration as their previous occupation.", "1942": "In many other cases, the skills of energy workers may not neatly align with other energy jobs that are created.", "1943": "Coal workers may face particular challenges on this front.", "1944": "Co ordination between government, labour unions and industry is critical to ensure that all workers that lose their jobs are able to access financial support and skills training and to promote the provision of alternative opportunities.", "1945": "Several parts of the energy industry are facing skill shortages today.", "1946": "This poses a risk to clean energy transitions.", "1947": "Many clean energy sectors compete for the same limited pool of trade workers, including construction workers, welders and electricians, and those with the necessary skills are in many cases already in short supply in the general buildings sector.", "1948": "Some skilled workers may move into clean energy from sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear and hydropower, but these sectors are also facing skills losses as older workers retire.", "1949": "Notable shortages have also emerged in recent years in manufacturing and transport.", "1950": "Employers are using a range of strategies to cope with the lack of skilled labour.", "1951": "Option include raising wages, adopting automation, increasing on the job training, and in some cases, accepting insufficiently skilled candidates for critical roles.", "1952": "The new clean energy economy offers substantial opportunities to stimulate local economies and improve the quality of life for workers.", "1953": "But capturing these benefits and preventing the skills gap from widening further requires both the public and private sectors to invest in education and training.", "1954": "Collaboration has an important part to play in getting the most from such investment.", "1955": "For example, closer partnerships between educational institutions and industry would help improve up to date curricula for future energy workers.", "1956": "Policies such as the European Skills Agenda and the US Inflation Reduction Act are looking to address these issues, but current efforts in these regions and elsewhere most likely need to be supplemented to prevent a shortage of skilled workers from becoming a bottleneck for the energy transition.", "1957": "The Covid 19 pandemic and global energy crisis setback efforts to expand electricity access.", "1958": "For the first time in decades, the number of people worldwide without access to electricity increased in 2022.", "1959": "The effects were felt most acutely in sub Saharan Africa, where the number of people without electricity access increased by around 15 million between 2019 and 2022.", "1960": "In 2023, the number of people worldwide without electricity access started to fall again, decreasing by around 13 million despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.", "1961": "Accelerated grid connections were the main driver of renewed progress in Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Senegal and Ethiopia.", "1962": "This was enabled by strong government support and affordability programmes such as the Hybrid Connection Programme in Uganda.", "1963": "There were also improvements in developing Asia, with Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines witnessing a large reduction in the number of people without access to electricity.", "1964": "Bangladesh achieved universal access in 2023.", "1965": "Solar home systems saw record sales for the second year in a row in 2023, with strong uptake in West Africa, even though there was an increasing share of grid connected households in developing Asia .", "1966": "Despite this progress, however, almost 750 million people still have no access to electricity around the world, 80% of which are in sub Saharan Africa.", "1967": "Progress to achieve universal access to clean cooking also slowed in the 2019 2022 period in many countries.", "1968": "Increased strains on household incomes and rising energy prices hindered progress.", "1969": "Plus, millions of households that had previously gained access reverted, at least temporarily, to traditional cooking fuels.", "1970": "Recent gains have come from well established, funded and targeted clean cooking policies, which were generally resilient even through the Covid 19 pandemic.", "1971": "Several notable programmes in China and India over the past ten years provided access to clean cookstoves to tens of millions of households.", "1972":

win public support for effective policies.", "1999": "For example, support for congestion charging in Stockholm, London and elsewhere increased significantly in the years following its introduction as parallel improvements were made in public transport and as citizens increasingly realised the benefits of reduced congestion and air pollution.", "2000": "Discretionary changes, such as reducing

gas from over 40% in 2021 to below 10% today.", "2270": "This is due in part to efforts to improve energy efficiency and boost renewables, but it also reflects a major switch away from Russian

than in the United States, and around 10% higher than in other advanced economies.", "2275": "A key factor behind this difference is the cost of repaying past capital investment in the European Union, which is nearly double that of the United States, and accounted for a third of total system costs on average in the 2019 2023 period.", "2276": "These higher costs stem from the European Union\u2019s early efforts to develop low emissions electricity sources, and in particular from its work in pioneering the large scale deployment of wind and solar PV in the 2010s at a time when they were nascent technologies and relatively expensive compared to today.", "2277": "Also contributing to high electricity costs in many EU member states is the cost of fossil fuel used in electricity generation,

challenges of energy transitions is ensuring that reductions in electricity system costs are reflected in consumer tariffs.", "2287": "Reforms in electricity market design and use of instruments such as long term contracts, including contracts for difference or power purchase agreements, can help align electricity prices with system costs.", "2288": "The expansion of renewables, the growth of nuclear capacity and the development of flexibility sources should all also weaken the link between the costs of natural gas fired power generation and wholesale electricity market prices.", "2289":
