it would cover approximately two thirds of the total investment needed to triple renewable capacity by 2030.", "73": "But an extra USD 500 billion per year is required in the IEA\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario  to fill the gap completely .", "74": "This equates to a doubling of current annual spending on renewable power generation, grids, and storage in 2030, in order to triple renewable capacity.", "75": "The goal of doubling the pace of energy efficiency improvement requires an even greater additional effort.", "76": "While investment in the electrification of transport is relatively strong and brings important efficiency gains, investment in other efficiency measures , notably building retrofits , is well below where it needs to be: efficiency investments in buildings fell in 2023 and are expected to decline further in 2024.", "77": "A tripling in the current annual rate of spending on efficiency and electrification , to about USD 1,9 trillion in 2030 , is needed to double the rate of energy efficiency improvements.", "78": "Anticipated oil and gas investment in 2024 is broadly in line with the level of investment required in 2030 in the Stated Policies

low emissions fuels, such as bioenergy and low emissions hydrogen, as well as CCUS.", "82": "Achieving net zero emissions globally by 2050 would mean annual investment in oil, gas, and coal falls by more than half, from just over USD 1 trillion in 2024 to below USD 450 billion per year in 2030, while spending on low emissions fuels increases tenfold, to about USD 200 billion in 2030 from just under USD 20 billion today.", "83": "The required increase in clean energy investments in the NZE Scenario is particularly steep in many emerging and developing economies.", "84": "The cost of capital remains one of the largest barriers to investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure in many EMDE, with financing costs at least twice as high as in advanced economies as well as China.", "85": "Macroeconomic and country specific factors are the major contributors to the high cost of capital for clean energy projects, but so, too, are risks specific to the energy sector.", "86": "Alongside actions by national policy makers, enhanced support from DFIs can play a major role in lowering financing costs and bringing in much larger volumes of private capital.", "87": "Targeted concessional support is particularly important for the least developed countries that will otherwise struggle to access adequate capital.", "88": "Our analysis shows cumulative financing for energy projects by DFIs was USD 470 billion between 2013 and 2021, with China based DFIs accounting for slightly over half of the total.", "89": "There was a significant reduction in financing for fossil fuel projects over this period, largely because of reduced Chinese support.", "90": "However, this was not accompanied by a surge in support for clean energy projects.", "91": "DFI support was provided almost exclusively  as debt  with only about 3% reported as equity financing and about 6% as grants.", "92": "This debt was provided in hard currency or in the currency of donors, with almost no local currency financing being reported.", "93": "The lack of local currency lending pushes up borrowing costs and in many cases is the primary reason behind the much higher cost of capital in EMDE compared to advanced economies.", "94": "High hedging costs often make this financing unaffordable to many of the least developed countries and raises questions of debt sustainability.", "95": "More attention is needed from DFIs to focus interventions on project de risking that can mobilise much higher multiples of private capital.", "96": "Meeting the targets for sustainable development, climate and energy security will require a substantial increase in capital investment in energy.", "97": "As these investments scale up globally, it is increasingly important to understand the prevailing trends affecting capital allocation decisions across various finance providers, which is why this year\u2019s World Energy Investment report begins with a chapter on finance.", "98": "This chapter provides an overview of current financing trends.", "99": "It makes a distinction between the notions of investment , understood as a capital expenditure used to build or acquire an asset , and finance, which encompasses the origin of the funds supporting an investment, as well as the form it takes and who is providing it.", "100": "Within the energy finance ecosystem, we explore the different roles played by capital providers , the ones who make the investment decisions , also known as \u201csources of investment\u201d , and finance providers.", "101": "This second group includes development finance institutions as well as other public and private sources capital , which we refer to as \u201csources of finance.\u201d", "102": "We also look at emerging themes such as transition finance and consider how the development of transition plans by financial institutions and corporations can support access to capital for hard to abate sectors.", "103": "The role of carbon markets and carbon pricing is also discussed.", "104": "The year 2023 was marked by a spike in interest rates across many countries , including advanced economies where relatively low inflation and low interest rates had prevailed for more than a decade in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.", "105": "While the 2020 2022 pandemic drove interest rates sharply lower across much of the world, inflation pressures mounted in 2022, changing this trajectory.", "106": "Compounding this trend, the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation  in early 2022 , as well as other geopolitical conflicts across the world , increased political risks, driving up the cost of capital.", "107": "Interest rates on long term, local currency government bonds , a benchmark indicator for the cost of capital in a country , rose considerably in many countries, with the notable exception of the People\u2019s Republic of China .", "108": "Yields on ten year United States Treasury bonds, for example, increased by about three percentage points between 2020 and 2023, with even larger differences in the US overnight interbank lending rate .", "109": "A similar trend was seen in bonds issued by European governments.", "110": "Sharp increases in US interest rates have a significant knock on effect for capital investments worldwide , including in emerging market and developing economies  , because the assets held by most large international investors, asset managers and financiers are valued in US dollars  and most major projects, regardless of geography, are also priced in USD.", "111": "On top of this, local currency financing has also become more expensive in many EMDE, including Brazil, Mexico, India and South Africa.", "112": "In addition to raising borrowing costs, higher interest rates also affect the cost of equity, which is estimated as the sum of the risk free rate  and the equity risk premium .", "113": "The expected equity internal rate of return  of utility scale solar photovoltaic  projects in the United States, for example, has soared in recent years, reaching between 8% and 9% in 2023.", "114": "But these USD rates of return are still about half of what foreign investors require to finance a similar project in some EMDE.", "115": "Although the variations in both EIRR and the cost of capital vary widely among EMDE, developing and emerging economies face higher costs of capital in general due to the greater risks , real or perceived , of investing in a particular jurisdiction and/or industrial sector.", "116": "This remains a significant barrier to increased levels of investment in these regions.", "117": "A higher cost of capital , the weighted average of the costs associated with raising funds for investments , makes it much more difficult to generate attractive risk adjusted returns.", "118": "This is especially true for relatively capital intensive clean energy technologies that require a large upfront investment, that are generally more dependent on debt financing  and where operating expenses tend to represent a relatively small share of total project costs.", "119": "Although ambitious government policies, technological advancements and declining cost trends  have helped offset some of the rise in capital costs, the general rise in interest rates and a stronger USD are not good news for investment anywhere.", "120": "The picture in China is somewhat different.", "121": "China did not suffer inflation pressures in the wake of the pandemic, but it has been battling relatively low economic growth and weakness in the property sector, with knock on effects for local banks.", "122": "This is why, unlike most of the world, China has kept benchmark lending rates low.", "123": "Elsewhere, there are signs that benchmark interest rates may not remain high for long.", "124": "There is ample debate on when and how fast they may come down, though most experts agree that the exceptional period of near zero interest rates is probably over.", "125": "The US Federal Reserve  has indicated that it plans to cut its short term benchmark by 75 basis points in 2024, although this expected rate cutting cycle has been delayed repeatedly because US inflation remains stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.", "126": "These movements are beyond the remit of energy policy makers, but will be important for determining the pace of the energy transition over the next years.", "127": "Since 2016, there has been a significant change in the types of energy assets being financed, but less of a change in where capital has come from.", "128": "Between 2016 and 2023, clean energy\u2019s share of total energy investment increased from around 50% to 63%.", "129": "Throughout this period, private sources of finance made up the bulk of spending, accounting for 73% in 2023.", "130": "While this share remains roughly the same by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, in absolute terms it represents an increase of USD 1,5 trillion in private sector spending.", "131": "The role of public financing , that is state owned enterprises , equity stakes in public assets such as government buildings and public vehicle fleets, as well as various subsidies and tax incentives , has decreased slightly.", "132": "Public finance plays a larger role in EMDE, accounting for 32% of spending between 2016 and 2023, compared with 14% in advanced economies.", "133": "Debt sustainability has become a growing concern across EMDE , three quarters of all developing economies have debt to GDP ratios of at least 75% , so mobilising a greater share of private finance in these markets will be essential.", "134": "Government investment in global energy assets has remained broadly stable at around 37% of assets for the 2015 2023 period.", "135": "The government plays a particularly prominent role in fossil fuel asset ownership, meaning they are most involved in the energy sector in regions with high fossil fuel production such as the Middle East, Russia and the Caspian states.", "136": "As these economies respond to the energy transition, many SOEs will remain responsible for electricity networks and utility scale power generation, while policy makers are increasingly positioning their SOEs to be key players in the energy transition.", "137": "Still, the role of SOEs in global energy financing is expected to decrease over time as end use sectors gradually take on a larger share of total investment.", "138": "In China, government ownership accounts for 60% of all energy assets and is particularly evident in fossil fuels, where nearly all of assets are government owned.", "139": "China has taken steps to support large SOEs and state owned banks to increase clean energy finance, including through the development of sustainable finance regulations and incentives, so state ownership is expected to remain prominent even as clean energy becomes a larger part of the energy mix.", "140": "As energy transitions have gained momentum in recent years, we have seen a rise in investments made by households.", "141": "Their share of new spending has doubled from 9% in 2015 to 18% in 2023.", "142": "This is due to growth in rooftop solar, energy efficiency in buildings and the purchase of electric vehicles.", "143": "With households taking on a higher share of energy investment, affordability and cost of living concerns may act as potential brakes on investment in the coming year.", "144": "Unlike corporations or governments, consumer finance operates under different constraints , use of proceeds, application processes, interest rates and fees, etc. , requiring unique policies and financing instruments.", "145": "The financial institutions supporting consumers with financing also have a different profile compared to financial institutions lending to utility scale projects.", "146": "This fundamental shift in the system emphasises the need for tailored approaches to support households in their transition towards sustainable energy practices.", "147": "Capital structure , that is the combination of debt and equity used to finance energy assets , has remained fairly stable over the last 8 years at around 46% debt.", "148": "This varies significantly between energy assets and regions.", "149": "Fossil fuels have the lowest share of debt at around 40%.", "150": "The last two years saw large repayments by oil and gas companies prior to that, a period of low commodity prices ate into fossil fuel companies\u2019 profitability, limiting their use of retained earnings to pay back debt.", "151": "For clean power, the share of debt is closer to 50% , down from 60% in the late 2010s , driven by the need for high upfront capital investment.", "152": "This change is partly due to better growth opportunities for the sector and lower equipment costs, but also to the contractual repayment of debt used for the upfront capital of previously installed clean power.", "153": "Meanwhile, the share of debt financing in the end use sectors , with higher household participation , is 45%, close to the average for all energy assets.", "154": "Reducing the uncertainty on debt financing availability is crucial for the energy transition.", "155": "Under the NZE Scenario, around 45% of investments in clean energy relies on debt , particularly in grid investment, where debt accounts for more than 50% of capital spending.", "156": "This trend will feed into the concerns about countries\u2019 capacity to sustain high levels of borrowing, particularly in EMDE.", "157": "Whether debt is provided on a corporate or project finance basis also matters.", "158": "Grids are typically financed on a corporate basis while solar PV and wind are increasingly on a project finance basis.", "159": "This ends up being particularly important in EMDE, where lending on a corporate basis to utilities is challenging without tackling the fundamental financial health of the utility.", "160": "Meanwhile, equity financing plays a key role in funding clean energy technologies with high upfront risks , such as geothermal or hydro , or less mature technologies like battery storage, carbon capture, and low carbon hydrogen.", "161": "As these technologies mature, the risks should fall, allowing more debt to be used.", "162": "Long construction timelines, such as for grid and nuclear, also increase the technology risks.", "163": "Equally, in less mature markets, even established technologies can count on a larger share of equity to take on the risks in development and construction phase.", "164": "As newer technologies and markets establish a track record, there is potential for the share of debt to increase as governments implement supportive policies to bolster business models with stable cash flows.", "165": "This can be particularly important in some EMDE, where a limited supply of equity  acts as a brake on the development of bankable projects.", "166": "This is where Development Finance Institutions  could step in to provide funds without increasing the debt burden in EMDE countries.", "167": "Sustainable finance regulations have recently provided a tailwind for clean energy investments, but 2023 was a challenging year for sustainable investment practices.", "168": "For the first time, sustainable funds saw a net outflow in the fourth quarter, notably including in Europe , home to 84% of sustainable funds by value.", "169": "Outflows have become common in the United States, occurring for the last five quarters as environmental, social and governance  issues become increasingly politicised.", "170": "Meanwhile, in Europe, sustainable funds consistently attracted larger proportional inflows than conventional funds, but the two have gradually converged in 2023 and as the market tightened, actively managed sustainable funds saw outflows for the first time.", "171": "This is likely due to a combination of factors, with many fund managers increasing their allocations to government bonds, and concern growing over the classification of sustainable funds.", "172": "Despite these concerns, the value of sustainable funds globally increased by 8% in 2023, driven by a rally in growth stocks .", "173": "The pushback against ESG in the United States had an impact beyond sustainable funds.", "174": "In February, two of the largest US based asset managers , JPMorgan Chase and State Street , withdrew from Climate Action 100+ , an investor led initiative designed to encourage decarbonisation by large emitters.", "175": "Blackrock also scaled back its involvement in the initiative, transferring participation from their US business to the smaller, international arm.", "176": "CA100+ has also seen withdrawals from Europe, including Swiss Re in March 2024, with most firms arguing that they can achieve similar goals through independent engagement with emitters.", "177": "Analysis of proxy voting patterns in 2024 indicates that support for climate related resolutions remains strong, but most of these are focused on emissions disclosure.", "178": "The departures from CA100+ came at a time when the initiative aimed to increase their focus on enactment of climate transition plans, as well as the continued push for improved disclosure.", "179": "There has been a growing emphasis on moving beyond disclosures to implementing transition plans, particularly among asset owners, who play a key role in the financing chain due to their ability to influence both corporate strategy and the approach of asset managers.", "180": "In December 2023, the UN Convened Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance  released guidance on how to strengthen engagement on transition planning, alongside development of credible plans for their own activities.", "181": "Several months later, the NZAOA also published guidelines for asset managers on how to support their asset owner clients through strengthened climate stewardship.", "182": "Banks play a particularly important role in the financing of energy projects", "183": "because of their large pools of capital  and because they provide funding at both the project and corporate level as well as to households, who play an increasing role in energy supply under the NZE Scenario.", "184": "Banks can support energy transitions through the design of sustainable loan products and engagement with the companies they finance.", "185": "Similarly, banks can create tailored consumer loan offerings to incentivise clean energy spending at the household level with products like green mortgages.", "186": "There is significant diversity within the banking sector, and the role of banks in the energy transition is likely to vary by their size and by region.", "187": "The UN convened Net Zero Banking Alliance  plays a leadership role, working across the sector to promote approaches to decarbonise lending, develop transition finance tools and facilitate the managed phase out of fossil fuels.", "188": "Currently, more than 140 banks are NZBA members, and around 40% of global banking assets are held by banks with net zero commitments.", "189": "Despite this, data from Bloomberg indicate that the ratio of clean energy funding  compared to fossil fuels has slightly worsened: For every 1 USD loaned to the fossil fuel sector in 2021, 75 cents went to clean energy companies.", "190": "By 2022, the ratio had fallen to 73 cents .", "191": "Sustainable finance regulations for the banking sector are primarily focused on improving disclosure.", "192": "For example, in November 2023, the Basel Committee published a draft climate disclosure framework for consultation aimed at improving the tracking of banks\u2019 progress on climate related activities.", "193": "However, several banks have expressed concerns about the metrics used to measure these activities.", "194": "Currently, the main metric used is financed emissions  but these emissions are not widely reported by companies and are hard to estimate accurately.", "195": "Furthermore, there is still debate over whether financed emissions are the best proxy for climate risk, with banks arguing for the use of multiple metrics, including a calculation related to transition finance.", "196": "Tighter regulations increase the risk that businesses in hard to abate sectors can no longer access financing from banks in markets with stricter climate regulations.", "197": "This forces those businesses to raise capital in markets with more lax environments, where banks are also less likely to engage with companies over transition plans.", "198": "This practice , financial carbon leakage , could delay change in the real economy.", "199": "Avoiding this outcome means increasing the number of banks committed to net zero, while also ensuring that sustainable finance regulation considers transition financing.", "200": "Currency risk is often cited as one of the primary drivers of high financing costs for energy projects, while also contributing to the growing debt problem in EMDE countries.", "201": "Given the scale of investment needs, funding from advanced economies will remain important.", "202": "Solutions such as hedging products allow hard currency funders to lend in local currencies, but these can add complexity and cost to financing arrangements.", "203": "Domestic financial institutions, which lend in local currency and are less subject to external shocks, also therefore play a key role.", "204": "There is currently significant variation in the role of domestic capital in energy financing based on the depth of local markets.", "205": "Domestic financing dominates in some of the larger EMDE, such as India and Brazil, or regions with well developed financial sectors such as ASEAN.", "206": "In these markets, various approaches allow local capital providers to invest in energy projects at an affordable rate, including tools like sustainable debt issuance, as in ASEAN, or mechanisms where the government absorbs some costs of commercial lenders, as in India.", "207": "In EMDE where the financial sector is less deep  institutional investors such as pension funds often primarily invest in government securities, with limited familiarity with other investment classes such as infrastructure.", "208": "New mechanisms are emerging to tap into this capital source.", "209": "For example, in Nigeria, InfraCredit , a local currency guarantee provider , has helped 19 local pension funds enter the energy sector, mobilising USD 206 million over the last five years.", "210": "This group of investors is most likely to invest in operational assets, including via refinancing structures that help free up development capital for greenfield assets Development finance institutions  are uniquely positioned to catalyse investment flows towards sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure, particularly in EMDE.", "211": "Along with direct financing, DFIs can provide policy support, capacity building, and concessional capital focused on de risking projects to mobilise private capital into otherwise high risk markets or technologies.", "212": "From 2013 to 2021, cumulative DFI financing reached approximately USD 468 billion globally, with China based DFIs and other DFIs accounting for 56% and 44%, respectively.", "213": "While energy financing from China\u2019s DFIs has fallen from its peak in 2016 , averaging around USD 27 billion in annual disbursements , other DFIs have been fairly constant in their financing, averaging USD 21 billion annually.", "214": "DFI financing was disbursed across regions, with Africa being the largest recipient, followed by Asia Pacific and Latin America.", "215": "Russia has also consistently received global energy financing through China\u2019s DFIs.", "216": "In terms of financial instruments, DFIs primarily provide debt, followed by significantly smaller amounts of grant and equity financing.", "217": "Less than half of the total debt financing is provided on highly concessional terms, or in the form of Official Development Assistance , where at least 10 45% of the loan is a grant equivalent.", "218": "The rest is provided under less concessional terms, and mostly from China.", "219": "It is also notable that nearly 80% of global DFI financing is reported to be provided in USD and EUR and limited amounts of local currency lending was available from DFIs excluding China.", "220": "This highlights the need to better construct development finance instruments that are more preferential and are better suited to the needs of EMDE borrowers.", "221": "With regard to technology, around 65% of DFI financing was directed towards clean energy, with investments in energy efficiency in transport and transmission and distribution grids accounting for more than 40%.", "222": "Notably, financing for fossil fuels continues, albeit from a smaller group of providers.", "223": "This includes Chinese DFIs which, in line with their pledge in 2021, have stopped financing new coal projects abroad, but do still provide funding to oil and gas projects.", "224": "Several signals point to increased participation by DFIs in energy financing.", "225": "According to the latest data, financing for energy related sectors from DFIs outside of China reached a record high of USD 31 billion in disbursements in 2022, an increase of more than 50% from the previous year.", "226": "A 2017 pledge by multilateral development banks  to Paris align their financial flows took effect in 2023, culminating in a joint MDB assessment framework for Paris alignment.", "227": "China\u2019s development finance in energy is also showing signs of revitalisation, with major announcements being made in the 3rd Belt and Road Forum in October 2023, such as the pledge to inject nearly USD 48 billion each to China Development Bank and the Export Import Bank of China to finance \u201csmall yet smart\u201d projects, with an emphasis on green investments, as well as a USD 11 billion replenishment of the Silk Road Fund, the main investment platform for the Belt and Road Initiative.", "228": "It is also notable that China has increasingly expanded its financing through state owned commercial banks, such as the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, especially through syndicated loans alongside various multilateral institutions, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development .", "229": "While it is important for DFIs to continue to channel their own capital into EMDE, including by acting as implementation partners for development aid from their donor governments, it is crucial to ensure that such resources also lead to effective mobilisation of the private sector.", "230": "From 2012 to 2022, an average of USD 12 billion was mobilised for climate from the private sector annually , of which nearly USD 8 billion went to energy, industry, construction and transport.", "231": "The Latin America and Caribbean region was the largest recipient of mobilised private finance , followed by Asia  and Africa , demonstrating how middle income countries are more likely to be the destination for private sector financing.", "232": "Under the NZE Scenario, private finance increases across all EMDE regions by 2030.", "233": "So finding solutions that can utilise DFI capital to de risk private investments in lower income countries will be essential to meet investment goals.", "234": "Increasing global co operation on climate change can support clean energy investment via climate finance flows to EMDE.", "235": "Countries put forward their short to medium term climate commitments in Nationally Determined Contributions .", "236": "The majority of NDCs have a target covering the energy sector.", "237": "Around 70% of current NDCs contain a conditional component, the implementation of which is contingent on a range of possible conditions.", "238": "These include financial, technical and capacity building support.", "239": "Some countries specify the level of financial support they would need to receive to implement their conditional NDC component this can help increase clarity, transparency and understanding of these commitments.", "240": "However, estimating the financial support needed for clean energy investments reported in NDCs is difficult to analyse due to fragmented and unstandardised data.", "241":

report in 2021 on the determination of needs of EMDE", "243": " ", "244": "the Standing Committee on Finance also concluded that there were significant gaps in the requests for investment support across the nine types of national reports to the UNFCCC.", "245": "This discrepancy could be attributed to several factors.", "246": "For instance, some EMDE might not need international financial support to implement their own proposed mitigation measures .", "247": "Some NDCs may not fully capture the necessary clean energy investments, potentially also due to a lack of detailed planning.", "248": "Another factor could be the limited availability of data or a limited capacity to estimate clean energy investment needs.", "249": "African countries stand out for including estimates of financial support requirements in their NDCs that are closely aligned with the IEA\u2019s Announced Pledges Scenario .", "250": "The next round of NDCs, expected by early 2025, presents a crucial opportunity for countries to act on the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake , a process that culminated at COP28 and evaluated the collective progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.",

Brazil\u2019s presidencies of the G20 and COP30 have made it a priority to support countries to transform their next round of NDCs into investable plans.", "253": "A clearer assessment of financial support needed in NDCs would have also been important input for the discussions of the New Collective Quantified Goal  on climate finance, which will replace the USD 100 billion goal set in 2009.", "254": "Current discussions around the NCQG address its potential quantum, scope and structure, and will culminate at COP29.", "255": "Sustainable debt issuances reached approximately USD 1,2 trillion in 2023, exceeding USD 1 trillion for a third consecutive year.", "256": "Nonetheless, this represents a 14% decline from 2022 levels, and a 23% drop from the peak in 2021.", "257": "Over the last two years, rising interest rates have been a constraining factor, with both the number and size of issuances decreasing.", "258": "During this period, debt issuance from energy and utilities companies also fell from a high of more than USD 280 billion in 2021 to USD 229 billion in 2023 , though it remains above 2020 levels.", "259": "The biggest declines have been concentrated mainly in sustainability linked debt, which in 2023 registered a 50% drop from the previous year, reaching only USD 284 billion.", "260": "By sector, real estate showed the biggest decrease, followed by utilities and automobiles manufacturing.", "261": "Some of this decline is likely due to investors\u2019 concerns around the credibility of sustainability linked debt as a tool to drive rapid transitions, as well as industry specific drivers, such as the contraction of the US commercial real estate market.", "262": "Meanwhile, new issuance of green bonds , the most mature sustainable debt instrument , reached a record USD 650 billion in 2023 and accounted for more than half of total issuances.", "263": "The steady increase in green bond issuance mainly comes from sovereigns, notably China, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany.", "264": "Sustainable debt issuance remains concentrated in advanced economies, which account for over three quarters, and China, which accounts for a further 11%.", "265": "However, there are signs of growth within other EMDE, which saw their share of issuance rise to 14% in 2023 from 8% in 2020.", "266": "This has been driven by broadening use cases, as seen with two large bond issuances for green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia, and the instruments, such as the sovereign sustainability linked bond from the Chilean government.", "267": "The EUR and USD remain the primary currencies for issuance, accounting for 38% and 28%, respectively.", "268": "While this helps to attract international investors, it exposes issuers in EMDE to currency risks.", "269": "With many EMDE grappling with rising debt levels, the borrowing at lower interest rates through sustainable debt instruments makes them an attractive tool, particularly for financing large public infrastructure projects.", "270": "Initial indications from 2024 have given a generally positive outlook for sustainable debt issuances for the year.", "271": "Although there may be some volatility due to political events, the fundamentals of the market, particularly for green bonds, remain strong and growth is expected in areas such as transition finance .", "272": "Additionally, the European Green Bond Standard, which comes into force in 2024, is expected to increase market confidence by strengthening disclosure requirements.", "273": "Achieving the NZE Scenario requires a broad range of investments.", "274": "Some of these can easily be classified as clean energy, but many others are less easy to define.", "275": "Under the NZE Scenario, technologies that could provide or enable zero emission energy or energy services account for 47% of spending in 2030, and those that provide emissions reductions but do not themselves deliver zero emissions energy or energy services account for 7%.", "276": "Both categories struggle to attract financing earmarked for clean energy and are at risk of being excluded by investors seeking to decarbonise their portfolios.", "277": "Transition finance is a framework that can support these activities.", "278": "Several organisations such as ICMA, CBI, GFANZ, OECD and others have developed transition finance guidance, covering activities such as retrofitting and substantiating assets, investment in alternatives to fossil fuel use, and the role of engagement by financial institutions.", "279": "Despite these guidelines, there is still significant variation in transition finance methodologies, with ICMA finding three overlapping definitions ranging from economy wide to only hard to abate sectors.", "280": "Transition related bonds have been a preferred labelled tool for hard to abate sectors.", "281": "Oil refining and marketing, industrials and metals and mining accounted for 34% of issuances in the last three years these sectors accounted for only 15% of green bonds over the same period.", "282": "Transition related bonds issuances in 2023 accounted for just USD 3,5 billion , less than 1% of all sustainable debt issuances and are geographically concentrated in Japan, Italy and China.", "283": "Establishing viable, science based transition plans is a vital first step to expanding the use of transition debt instruments.", "284": "Transition plans are generally understood as aligning with the Paris Agreement, and spelling out transition pathways, actions and interim targets.", "285": "These elements are fundamental for engagement between corporates and investors, as well as tracking progress.", "286": "Governments and regulators have taken different approaches to establishing transition activities.", "287": "For example, Europe and Singapore are using taxonomies to define transition activities, while Japan has created industry roadmaps.", "288": "Coverage can vary based on the regional methodologies, but both taxonomies and roadmaps can support an increase in funding, including from advanced economies where investors may be subject to stricter rules covering sustainable finance.", "289": "Even with the provision of stronger transition plans and roadmaps, some additional obstacles have been observed.", "290": "For example, on the issuer side, especially in EMDE, the data necessary to create transition plans and track progress is not always available.", "291": "External support may therefore be necessary to help the development of this type of financing and, at least initially, such instruments will only be viable for larger companies with the resources to develop this data.", "292": "On the supply side, many EMDE have sovereign ratings that are below investment grade, making it hard to attract investment from capital markets via instruments such as bonds without de risking support from concessional finance providers.", "293": "Particularly in EMDE with fossil fuel intensive energy mixes, this use of concessional financing could have a significant real world impact , especially if it leads to a \u201ccrowding in\u201d of private sector investors.", "294": "A further challenge is that many investors have net zero targets that rely on financed emissions as one of their primary metrics.", "295": "Even though transition activities may be in line with a taxonomy or roadmap, they generally have higher emissions than purely clean activities, which would risk skewed investors\u2019 efforts to reduce their financed emissions.", "296": "Further consideration is needed on appropriate indicators that can monitor institutions\u2019 proper progress and acceleration of funding for future energy transition of real economy.", "297": "In February 2024, Japan issued the world's first sovereign transition bonds , Japan Climate Transition Bonds .", "298": "Two offerings of JPY 800 billion  each were issued, with tenors of 5 and 10

"302": "The plan is accompanied by transition roadmaps for each sector, which were developed by expert committees of public and private stakeholders.", "303": "These roadmaps allow investors to identify transition activities and can also be used by companies for internal transition planning.", "304": "The investment plan also includes an emphasis on nascent technologies, which will receive over half of the proceeds of JCTBs.", "305": "The JCTBs also include a novel approach to carbon pricing.", "306": "Normally, revenue from carbon pricing can only fund future energy transition activity, that is after the carbon has been paid.", "307": "This delays in the impact of the carbon pricing but Japan\u2019s approach was to build the future pricing revenue into the issuance, by assuming this is the capital government will use to make repayments on the bonds.", "308": "This allows for the government to immediately take advantage of the assumed future revenue of carbon taxes.", "309": "The JCTBs approach can potentially be repurposed for EMDE.", "310": "With the government playing the role of credit intermediary, this could enhance corporates\u2019 creditworthiness and eliminate the complexity of financing for small scale projects.", "311": "Countries with sub investment grade credit ratings, may need additional credit enhancements , such as guarantees from DFIs , to help facilitate access to international capital markets.", "312": "Carbon pricing is a key instrument for mitigating emissions, encouraging investment in low carbon technologies and reducing demand for emissions intensive activities.", "313": "Carbon pricing instruments include compliance carbon pricing instruments , such as carbon taxes, emissions trading systems  or hybrids of the two, as well as baseline and credit systems, which generate carbon credits.", "314": "These two types of carbon pricing instruments can contribute in different ways to financing the clean energy transition, depending on the specific local contexts.", "315": "As of May 2024, 75 CCPIs were in place worldwide.", "316": "All CCPIs cover the energy sector and 23% of global greenhouse gas  emissions.", "317": "Aggregate revenues from CCPIs hit a new record high in 2023 and, for the first time, revenues surpassed USD 100 billion , of which roughly half was generated by Europe\u2019s ETS.", "318": "A few notable energy sector related developments in CCPIs also took place: Canada introduced a regulatory framework for a federal cap and trade system for the oil and gas sector , its largest source of GHG emissions.", "319": "Meanwhile, as part of a broader reform, the European Union extended the coverage of its ETS by including its domestic maritime sector, which represents 3% to 4% of total EU CO2 emissions.", "320": "Indonesia introduced a new intensity based ETS for the power generation sector.", "321": "Brazil passed a new draft law for cap and trade.", "322": "Moreover, in October 2023, the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism  also entered its transitional phase , introducing reporting requirements only , in preparation for a definitive regime that will start in 2026.", "323": "Voluntary carbon credit markets have come under particular scrutiny in 2023, with some projects being accused of over crediting, of lacking additionality or of enabling human rights abuses.", "324": "This, alongside inconclusive negotiations at COP28 on Article 6 rules, impacted the issuance of energy related carbon credits in 2023.", "325": "Retirements of credits remained high in 2023, after reaching a peak in 2022.", "326": "However, a surplus of unsold legacy credits has been accumulating in recent years, reaching around 480 million credits in 2023.", "327": "This keeps the costs of most energy related carbon credits much lower than the real cost of mitigation.", "328": "To address questions that some have raised on the integrity of some legacy credits, CORSIA has introduced cut off dates for eligible credits.", "329": "Recent initiatives were also set up to improve the quality of carbon credit supply  as well as demand .", "330": "There are still 750 million people living without access to electricity globally and more than 2 billion people without clean cooking solutions.", "331": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 7 , universal energy access by 2030 , will require annual spending of at least USD 42 billion beginning in 2024.", "332": "This represents a massive increase in spending, particularly in Africa, where energy access projects have struggled to attract more than USD 5 billion annually.", "333": "Energy access investments are particularly challenging given that they are small scale, and the risks associated with the end user are often high.", "334": "Mounting debt at utilities has slowed grid connections, challenges over demand stimulation have put pressure on mini grid business models, and non payment risks have impacted profitability for providers of home solar systems.", "335": "Meanwhile, it is difficult to keep clean cooking solutions affordable for end users without the use of carbon credits, a market that has faced credibility concerns.", "336": "Financial aggregation solutions have emerged as a way to raise more private capital for access projects.", "337": "In May 2023, Sun King, an off grid electricity

of the more commercial projects.", "342": "Ensuring the availability of affordable capital will be vital for driving rapid energy transitions.", "343": "It is critical not only for financing projects and companies, but also for supporting the enabling environment and facilitating necessary spending by households.", "344": "Current market conditions , particularly the rising interest rate environment , have resulted in higher financing costs and highlight the need for innovative risk mitigation instruments and support mechanisms, particularly for EMDE.", "345": "Tightening market conditions have also contributed to a setback in sustainable finance instruments as more financial players voice concerns about regulations becoming overly stringent, especially when it comes to financing high emitting, hard to abate sectors.", "346": "Clean energy projects should adopt a diversified financing strategy that leverages the strengths and risk appetites of each source of capital.", "347": "While private sector investment is particularly dominant in advanced economies, growing domestic private financial sector financing in energy in EMDE is particularly important, as it reduces currency risk and reliance on external sources.", "348": "Attention is also due for households, which have also become increasingly prominent as providers of capital, as observed by the near doubling of their share of energy asset ownership between 2015 and 2023.", "349": "Given the increases in the cost of living, maintaining affordability of services will be vital over the course of 2024, which may require additional support from public sources.", "350": "DFIs can also play a role in ensuring affordability and providing capital in higher risk markets and technologies.", "351": "Appropriate tools and systems need to be in place to direct finance towards energy investment in EMDE as a catalyst for clean energy transitions.", "352": "This includes enhancing the credibility of carbon markets, which have faced criticism related to over crediting, lack of additionality and enabling human rights abuses.", "353": "Furthermore, improving transition finance mechanisms, and strengthening sustainable finance regulations, especially in the context of the potential impact on financing high emitting, hard to abate sectors, can help ensure that financing supports the differing trajectories of EMDEs compared to advanced economies.", "354": "On the EMDE side, providing an accurate assessment of financial needs for clean energy investments around NDCs will be crucial.", "355": "This can be used as a basis for engagement in some of the global efforts to accelerate financing for energy transitions, such as at the upcoming G20 discussions, or via initiatives such as the ongoing Bridgetown Initiative that aims to reform the global financial architecture to better support EMDE.", "356": "Global investment in the power sector grew by 15% in 2023, reaching a record USD 1,3 trillion.", "357": "Concerns over high interest rates and the profitability of renewables firms were offset by lower prices for solar PV modules, coupled with rapid renewables deployment in major economies including China, the European Union and the United States.", "358": "Growth is set to continue in 2024 but at a more modest pace.", "359": "Global spending on renewables also hit a new record of USD 735 billion, driven by solar PV and wind.", "360": "China alone saw solar PV spending jump to USD 220 billion , almost half of global solar investment for the year , with capacity additions multiplying by a factor of 2,5 compared to 2022 thanks to falling module prices and pandemic recovery effects.", "361": "As prices for solar modules and other key clean energy technologies continue to fall, we are now expecting the growth of spending for renewables to slow down , especially for distributed solar PV , and reach USD 770 billion in 2024.", "362": "This does not reflect a slowdown in the renewable power capacity added, as price decreases allow for more capacity to be added per USD spent.", "363": "Nonetheless, grid and curtailment concerns, permitting delays and land availability remain constraining factors.", "364": "As renewables expanded in 2023, capital expenditures on fossil fuel power decreased by 10%, to USD 90 billion, led by declines in coal fired power.", "365": "For 2024, we are expecting a similar decrease to USD 80 billion, again driven by coal  and to a smaller extent by gas fired power .", "366": "Spending on fossil fuel power with carbon capture utilisation and storage  remained below USD 1 billion and was concentrated in China.", "367": "While investment in nuclear power remained largely unchanged in 2023, expected growth of around 20% in 2024 promises renewed momentum.", "368": "However, most of this spending growth in the next few years will be driven by lifetime extensions rather than investment in new nuclear capacity.", "369": "Investment in hydropower fell slightly and is expected to be even lower in 2024.", "370": "Investment in electricity grids reached USD 375 billion, translating to a 9% average growth rate globally.", "371": "Notable success stories for grids were in advanced economies as well as China and Latin America.", "372": "Investment by other emerging market and developing economies  still lagged the global average, and even declined in some regions.", "373": "Battery storage investment grew in line with our strong expectations, reaching USD 40 billion.", "374": "Final investment decisions  continue to demonstrate a mixed picture.", "375": "While FIDs for utility scale renewables were at record highs, those for unabated coal fired power plants also increased to levels not seen since 2015, with almost all of these made in China.", "376": "While total power sector investment in EMDE outside China increased to USD 270 billion in 2023 , a record , its growth rate of 12% still lagged the 16% average for advanced economies and China.", "377": "Renewable power spending rose by almost one fifth and now represents half of total power sector investment in other EMDE regions.", "378": "Investment in grids increased to USD 80 billion , the highest level since 2018 , with further growth expected for 2024.", "379": "Spending on nuclear and batteries also increased, while investments in fossil fuel power generation dipped slightly.", "380": "Strong renewable power investment in EMDE outside China was driven by significant spending in India, Southeast Asia, Brazil and Africa, thanks to policy reforms and the introduction of well organised public tenders, as well as grid improvements.", "381": "The volume of renewable energy capacity that was auctioned in India, for example, topped 20 gigawatts  in 2023 , more than double that of 2022 , with a particular focus on solar PV and projects that combine renewables with storage.", "382": "Seeking to tackle its \u201cstate of disaster\u201d in the electricity sector, South Africa also concluded its first battery procurement programme and is seeking to add an additional 5 GW of renewables and 600 megawatts  of battery storage.", "383": "Latin America notably increased its spending on grids in 2023.", "384": "Brazil led the way with a record USD 8 billion auction, while Colombia and Panama revived interconnection plans.", "385": "On the other hand, investment in grids in Southeast Asia and Africa stalled.", "386": "Overall, however, power sector investment in EMDE outside China still represented only around 20% of the global total, while advanced economies and China were responsible for more than USD 1 trillion in spending.", "387": "We expect this trend to persist in 2024, which means that overall spending is still not on track to meet current climate and energy access goals.", "388": "One major reason for this is the high cost of capital for clean energy projects in EMDE regions outside China, which is often double or triple the cost in advanced economies.", "389": "While renewable companies in advanced economies saw improved profitability in 2023, lower prices for natural gas and deeper market penetration by low cost renewables are starting to put pressure on wholesale electricity prices , creating uncertainties for their revenue streams.", "390": "This, in turn, puts additional scrutiny on future investments , one reason we expect growth in renewable power investment to slow in 2024.", "391": "In some European countries, for example, average wholesale electricity prices have fallen to their lowest levels since 2021 , and have regularly dipped into negative territory.", "392": "This underscores the pressing need for greater investment in power grids, interconnectors and storage infrastructure as the share of intermittent renewables increases.", "393": "Solar PV and wind projects continue to offer attractive investment prospects, despite profitability challenges in the manufacturing business.", "394": "Renewable utility profitability is slowly returning to pre pandemic levels, with returns on invested capital  increasing by one third in 2023 from a year earlier, thanks to falling solar and wind costs.", "395": "ROIC is also notably more stable compared to the volatility of oil and gas companies in recent years.", "396": "That said, the average cost of capital for renewable power firms has increased slightly in recent years, now hovering at around 7% of market value.", "397": "An exception to the trend of improving profitability was offshore wind.", "398": "2023 saw a range of contract cancellations due to previously agreed low prices that were no longer viable given supply chain challenges, cost increases and permitting delays.", "399": "In the United States, for example, 7 GW of planned capacity was cancelled while another 4 GW are subject to contract renegotiations at prices that are on average around two times higher.", "400": "There were multiple cancellations in the United Kingdom as well, with the 2023 auction not attracting a single offer, prompting an increase of the strike price by 165% for its 2024 auction.", "401": "Nonetheless, successful contract renegotiations, adjustments in auctions and regulatory support such as the European Union\u2019s wind power package are all positive signs that demonstrate the need for regulators to remain responsive to changing market conditions.", "402": "On the manufacturing side, 2023 was dominated by significant price declines and concerns about overcapacity.", "403": "As manufacturing capacity continues to grow within the Chinese solar PV sector, listed solar firms , dominated by Chinese entities , are starting to see their profit margins shrink.", "404": "Despite government support for domestic manufacturing, cost pressures have led to some cancellations of expansion plans , and in some cases, existing plant closures , in Europe, the United States and India.", "405": "That said, falling prices for solar modules led to a 5% drop in the global average levelised cost of electricity  for solar PV last year.", "406": "Companies specialised in wind turbines , a sector dominated by European manufacturers", "407": ", struggled for roughly two years with various supply chain, cost and technical issues.", "408": "But by 2023, profitability had largely recovered, reaching similar levels as solar PV manufacturers.", "409": "Wind turbines produced by Chinese companies continue to be around one third the price of European made turbines and have had some limited success in winning onshore wind auctions in Europe and Asia.", "410": "However, overseas expansion plans by Chinese wind turbine producers face obstacles due to more complex logistics and higher operation and maintenance costs.", "411": "Clean technology manufacturing is surging: The sector accounted for 4% of global GDP growth in 2023.", "412": "Clean technology manufacturing attracted almost USD 200 billion in investment last year , a 70% jump from 2022 , with solar PV and battery manufacturing plants leading the way.", "413": "Investment in solar PV

clean technology manufacturing in 2023.", "415": "China accounted for three quarters of global clean technology manufacturing investment, down from 85% in 2022, as investment in the United States and Europe accelerated.", "416": "This geographic concentration is set to continue to 2030, with China, the United States and the European Union together projected to account for around 80% to 90% of manufacturing capacity for solar PV, wind, battery, electrolyser and heat pumps.", "417": "This surge in clean technology manufacturing is, however, creating significant overcapacities , especially for solar PV and batteries.", "418": "Existing capacity for solar modules and cells is already sufficient to meet demand under the NZE Scenario in 2030.", "419": "As a result, prices for solar PV modules and batteries have fallen to historic lows.", "420": "However, these facilities are also seeing relatively low utilisation rates and profit margins are being compressed.", "421": "Wholesale electricity prices in Europe are declining, with some reaching their lowest levels since 2021.", "422": "Lower natural gas prices, increased hydro and nuclear output, and reduced demand, are all driving down wholesale prices.", "423": "As renewable capacity grows, power production from these sources is also reaching unprecedented levels, occasionally resulting in negative prices and increased volatility.", "424": "For instance, Spain achieved record high solar power production in the first quarter of 2024 with prices averaging 43 USD/MWh , and sometimes approaching zero.", "425": "Germany and the Netherlands also experienced brief periods of negative prices in March 2024.", "426": "While electricity prices in the United States have been below those in Europe for a while , prices have dipped to record lows in recent months.", "427": "The rise in affordable electricity benefits consumers and is a welcome respite from the record highs during the energy crisis.", "428": "At the same time, it increases uncertainty for renewables companies as revenue streams come under pressure and become more unpredictable , leading to greater scrutiny of the future growth prospects for renewables investments.", "429": "Developers who choose not to co locate their wind and solar PV power parks alongside battery storage or other sources of flexibility may see a drop in potential revenues during peak generation , hampering profits and discouraging investment.", "430": "Enhanced coordination between renewables production, storage and demand response is needed to manage the balance between price levels and growing volatility.", "431": "Further grid expansion is also urgently needed to mitigate price swings in both directions.", "432": "Increased interconnection in Europe offers an opportunity to optimise electricity flow, especially when prices differ between regions.", "433": "During the energy crisis, for example, Spain and Portugal experienced lower power prices than the rest of Europe due to their ample electricity production from solar PV and wind, while a lack of interconnection constrained electricity flow to higher price markets in central Europe.", "434": "Despite a drop in the number of approvals for natural gas power plants, FIDs for unabated fossil fuel generation rose to 110 GW in 2023, driven by a 30% year on year increase in coal fired capacity.", "435": "Even as its contribution to natural gas FIDs declined significantly and clean power expanded drastically, China is still the source of the vast majority of this unabated fossil fuel generated capacity, accounting for 95% of the world\u2019s coal fired plants that reached financial close.", "436": "In fact, if China were excluded, global approvals of unabated fossil fuel generation would have decreased by 3% last year.", "437": "The main drivers for this proposed capacity expansion are ongoing security of supply concerns amid the underperformance of hydropower in China, inflexible interprovincial electricity export contracts and rising electricity demand, as well as pressure on provincial governments to prioritise economic growth.", "438": "Against a backdrop of rapid expansion of renewables capacity in China, these new unabated fossil fuel power plants face the prospect of very low utilisation and reliance on capacity markets.", "439": "It remains unclear whether this new capacity will be used primarily for flexibility purposes or for baseload generation, but the potential implications for China\u2019s emissions in the latter case are significant given the government\u2019s carbon intensity target.", "440": "In India, new coal FIDs doubled from a year earlier, to 2 GW in 2023 , their highest level since 2019 , as the country sought to meet higher than expected electricity demand.", "441": "In the rest of the world, only two countries , Russia and the Philippines , approved meaningful increases in new coal fired capacity for development.", "442": "It appears, therefore, that most countries and financiers are following through with their pledges to stop supporting new coal fired power plants.", "443": "In contrast to coal, FIDs for gas fired power generation fell by 10% in 2023 , reaching 60 GW , although they remained above the average of recent years.", "444": "China still approved the largest share of gas fired plants, but the number dropped significantly, leading to a lower share of plants reaching financial close among net importers of natural gas.", "445": "Elsewhere, FIDs for new gas plants increased in the Caspian region  in particular, due to an influx of cheap Russian gas, while Nigeria has started to invest in gas fired power stations using its domestic gas reserves.", "446": "Elsewhere, approvals of new gas FIDs in the United States, Europe and Asia in 2023 were in line with recent years.", "447": "At the same time, new projects in the Middle East and North Africa  region fell by 50%.", "448": "Moreover, all new gas FIDs were for combined cycle gas turbine plants , which indicates that these new projects are looking for operating at higher utilisation rates.", "449": "FIDs for utility scale renewable projects increased by 15% year on year to almost USD 400 billion in 2023, an all time high.", "450": "FIDs for solar plants represented more than half of the total at USD 220 billion , a new record and 2,5 times the amount approved in 2020.", "451": "Wind power recovered somewhat from the previous year\u2019s drop due to a strong recovery in offshore FIDs, while fewer onshore wind projects were approved.", "452": "The total numbers of utility scale deals continued to increase significantly as the combined value of deals above USD 1 billion more than doubled.", "453": "Thanks to the European Union\u2019s \u201cFit for 55\u201d package, as well as improvements to the region\u2019s auctions and permitting, approvals of utility scale renewable projects there rose by 50%, led by Germany, France and Poland.", "454": "Similarly, the United States saw FIDs increase by 20%, with a bumper fourth quarter after details of the Inflation Reduction Act were disclosed.", "455": "Elsewhere, notable jumps were also observed in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.", "456": "In a strong year for hydropower, FIDs for large scale hydro plants increased to 32 GW from 14 GW in 2022.", "457": "This was the highest level seen since 2017 , a promising sign for a technology that will play an important role in providing future baseload and energy storage services.", "458": "China dominated approvals , which approved FIDs for more than 23 GW , India, Indonesia, Laos, Viet Nam and Angola.", "459": "Pumped hydro , which can serve as energy storage , constituted more than 70% of hydropower FIDs.", "460": " ", "461": "In 2023, China and Egypt were the only countries starting the construction of new nuclear power plants .", "462": "The fact that nuclear continues to stagnate is cause for concern, even though additional capital is being spent on modernising and extending the lifetimes of existing plants, which is not captured by FIDs.", "463": "The strong growth in approvals of utility scale renewables suggests that the construction delays and supply chain constraints of past years have been largely resolved.", "464": "However, a range of issues is still hampering the scaling up of renewable capacity: Advanced economies face land acquisition, permitting and grid connection delays, for example, while China is keen to keep renewables curtailment rates at 10%.", "465": "In EMDE outside China, FIDs are still lagging behind , with the exception of India and Brazil , and will require addressing in particular the high cost of capital for clean energy projects.", "466": "Doing so will mean establishing clear and stable regulatory frameworks, reducing off taker risk and deploying concessional finance where necessary.", "467": "For 2024, we are therefore expecting overall growth to continue, but growth in FIDs for utility scale renewables will slow in USD terms as costs continue to fall.", "468": "There were positive changes in the grid landscape in 2023.", "469": "In some regions, efforts to deploy networks for electrification increased, though the gains still fell short of what is needed.", "470": "Advanced economies and China continue to lead investment in power grids, accounting for about 80% of global spending.", "471": "China held its level of investment at USD 80 billion, with the government owned State Grid Corporation maintaining its appetite for new grids and networks.", "472": "Investment in advanced economies grew at a rate of 11% in 2023, led by the United States, which spent USD 100 billion , mostly on enhancing grid reliability and upgrading old infrastructure.", "473": "Spending in the European Union rose strongly, reaching USD 60 billion, bolstered by the European Commission\u2019s Grid Action Plan which targets more than USD 600 billion in spending on grids in the next six years.", "474": "Further investments in grid interconnection are very much required in the European Union to facilitate the flow of renewable power from southern to central European markets.", "475": "Generally, in advanced economies, a key challenge lies in sustaining investment growth and ensuring its effective translation throughout the supply chain.", "476": "Power transformers in particular encounter obstacles due to inflationary pressures and supply shortages.", "477": "Grid investment in EMDE outside China grew by an impressive 15%, reaching almost USD 80 billion in 2023.", "478": "However, this increase masked very different patterns in the underlying regions.", "479": "Investment in India, for example, remained flat despite the introduction of tenders for smart meters , of which only 10% of the government\u2019s original target number have been installed.", "480": "Investment in Africa and Southeast Asia also remained mostly unchanged.", "481": "However, this lack of new investment was partly offset by a doubling of spending in Latin America as countries like Colombia, Chile, Panama and Brazil made efforts to increase spending.", "482": "Brazil made particular progress , more than doubling its grid investments in 2023 and auctioning a record 10 500 km of grid .", "483": "Many EMDE are highly dependent on concessional financing and public funding for grid investment, which represented 80% of total investment in 2023.", "484": "Most of Southeast Asia lacks robust regulatory frameworks for private participation, for example.", "485": "In Viet Nam there is no public private partnership  infrastructure with a clear revenue model.", "486": "In Africa, more than half of investment comes from public sources , and only every third utility can recover operational and debt costs, even after including subsidies from governments.", "487": "One positive exception to this is South Africa, which plans to establish an independent transmission project office to procure new transmission capacity using a build operate transfer model.", "488": "Grid connectivity in Africa generally remains a challenge, however.", "489": "As we point out in our recent Battery Special Report, battery storage is a critical component for the energy transition.", "490": "In 2023, investments in battery storage reached more than USD 40 billion, 90% of which was concentrated in China, the United States and Europe.", "491": "But for every 1 USD invested in battery storage in advanced economies and China, only one cent was invested in other EMDE countries.", "492": "This lack of investment in EMDE is mainly due the absence of clear regulatory frameworks as well as high capital and financing costs.", "493": "Spending on battery storage in China increased by a factor of almost 2,5 in 2023 to USD 11 billion.", "494": "This comes as provinces rolled out capacity payment schemes that subsidise both discharging and charging.", "495": "In addition, many provinces require project developers to include a minimum of 10% to 20% of energy storage capacity in every new wind or solar project.", "496": "After this record year of renewables and battery deployment  we are expecting capital expenditure for battery storage in China to continue growing strongly in 2024, albeit at a slightly slower pace.", "497": "In the United States, investment also rose to USD 11 billion and we expect similar growth 2024.", "498": "This is supported by the US Inflation Reduction Act and liberalised power markets that allow for favourable storage economics, as well as strong dynamism in the residential battery market.", "499": "Even stronger growth has been held back by permitting issues and higher financing costs.", "500": "Europe saw battery storage investment more than double to USD 15 billion in 2023, with behind the meter applications , for example, battery storage combined with rooftop solar , performing particularly well in Germany and Italy and strong growth in utility scale systems in the United Kingdom.", "501": "Continued power price volatility, supportive energy storage auctions, and tax exemptions are expected to support a similar investment level in 2024 with progressively greater focus on utility scale systems.", "502": "The Asia Pacific region  increased its battery storage spending by 40% to almost USD 2,5 billion, led by Japan and Australia.", "503": "India did not meet its growth expectations due to project construction delays.", "504": "For select other markets, such as Chile, 2023 marked the take off year for battery storage as it passed legislation to incentivise energy storage and announced that it would be seeking to procure 5,4 GWh in energy storage and non variable renewables capacity by 2028 while setting aside USD 2 billion.", "505": "Despite high expectations for future capacity growth, investment spending will likely moderate over time as capital costs continue to come down.", "506": "After increasing in the previous year for the first time, capital costs returned to their 2021 levels in 2023 due to falling prices for critical minerals and expanding battery manufacturing capacity.", "507": "Capital costs also continued to be significantly lower in China than in Europe or the United States.", "508": "At the COP28 international climate conference in Dubai, countries famously signalled the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d of the fossil fuel era.", "509": "As part of this pledge, they agreed to triple installed renewables capacity by

storage and sources of flexibility payment guarantees and more concessional finance.", "513": "Under current policies and market conditions, renewables investment over the next seven years could meet around two thirds of the spending necessary to triple installed renewables capacity by 2030.", "514": "This creates a gap of around USD 400 billion per year in required spending on renewables between 2024 and 2030.", "515": "While advanced economies and China will need to increase their current annual investments by an average of 6% to meet the cumulative required, the spending gap is particularly pronounced in other EMDE regions, where annual investment will need to increase by 30% per year.", "516": "Key enablers for the tripling of installed renewables capacity are grids and battery storage.", "517": "While spending on grids has been relatively flat in recent years, there was significant growth in 2023 and investment is projected to further accelerate.", "518": "Despite this, in the IEA\u2019s Stated Policies Scenario , grid investment would still face a significant shortfall to the investment levels required for tripling renewables capacity.", "519": "Current global spending on grids needs to grow by an average of 11% every year to meet the cumulative required investment.", "520": "Tackling tariff risks, establishing forward looking regulatory frameworks and financing models to mobilise private capital are essential to facilitate this increase in investment levels.", "521": "Through its ability to smooth the load curve by storing electricity when it is produced in abundance and discharging when additional electricity is required by the system, battery storage is primed to support the variability of renewables generation.", "522": "Even though it experienced explosive growth in the past two years, in the STEPS battery storage investment could only meet around two thirds of the cumulative investment need.", "523": "Closing the gap will require current annual spending on battery storage to grow by 25% every year.", "524": "In our recent Special Report on Batteries, the IEA highlights the importance of clear and stable regulatory environments, as

2023.", "531": "This is led by national oil companies  in the Middle East and Asia.", "532": "The huge increase in revenues and profits during the price spikes of 2021 2022 has not translated into a similar sized rise in new capital expenditures.", "533": "More has gone towards dividends, share buybacks and net debt repayment than to new investments.", "534": "Upstream investment is focusing on

since homeowners tend to skew toward the top the age pyramid , public guarantees for home equity loans could help to de risk commercial financing for renovations.", "870": "Overall, these difficulties are compounded by a regulatory landscape which can be perceived as a moving signpost.", "871": "As public budgets become tighter in many parts of the world, governments are tempted to cancel or scale back incentive mechanisms for renovations or green buildings, thereby reducing demand.", "872": "One concrete example is from makers of insulation materials, who invested heavily in manufacturing capacity on the assumption that demand for renovation materials would rapidly materialise at scale.", "873": "But recent hesitation by several European countries over whether to maintain incentive

almost 90 000 units in 2023.", "895": "In Brazil, electric car registrations nearly tripled year on year to more than 50 000 units, supported by the entry of imported Chinese models, a trend we could expect to see more of as Chinese carmakers prioritise EMDE markets over the United States and Europe.", "896": "EV registration in India increased by 70% year on year thanks to purchase incentives under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles  scheme, supply side incentives under the Production Linked Incentive scheme, tax benefits and the Go Electric campaign.", "897": "In 2024, global EV sales growth is expected to slow to around 20%.", "898": "Contradicting forces are at play: A certain level of market maturity might have been reached in China, while the reduction or cancellation of some subsidies in China, Europe and India cloud the horizon for future sales.", "899": "On the other hand, several factors should continue to support growth, including: recent price drops in many EV models renewed activity in the commercial fleet segment and new emissions standards such as those proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency.", "900": "More targeted policy incentives, such as a French programme offering a EUR 100 per month EV lease to low income households, could also be of help. .", "901": "Despite drops in EV prices across the range of models, the largest EV manufacturers have been able to maintain their profit margins by delaying the pass through of falling battery prices to their customers.", "902": "Lower battery costs, supported by record levels of investment in manufacturing, should lead to further reductions in EV retail prices and increased sales.", "903": "But as the market enters a new era of slightly slower growth, the car industry , which has seen many new entrants in recent years , is likely to experience lower market capitalisations, increased consolidation, spending restraint and eroding margins amid price competition and slowing sales.", "904": "The cancellation of two long awaited IPOs of the battery and EV branches of Volkswagen and Renault points to a degree of investor scepticism about whether EV sales will be able to keep growing at the rates seen in recent years, especially in Europe.", "905": "The story seems to be different in EMDEs, where in India for instance, companies like Exicom are starting to look to the capital markets for funding expansion into EVs.", "906": "Announcements of new capital expenditures and additions of new battery manufacturing capacity continue to point to positive prospects for the sector globally.", "907": "Global sales of electric buses reached about 50 000 units in 2023, which represented 3% of total bus sales.", "908": "Roughly 60% of those sales

\u201cgreen\u201d development among heavy polluting manufacturers such as steel companies.", "922": "In practice, however, most subsidies to steel firms have gone to support investment in expanding capacity and capital equipment rather than targeting R&D expenses or investment in efficiency gains.", "923": "Compared with global capital expenditures across all industrial sectors , energy efficiency and other end use investments have stalled, representing 13% of total investment in 2023 compared to 14% in 2017.", "924": "This suggests that even in a period of high energy costs such as 2021 2022, investments in energy efficiency and end use have not been a priority.", "925": "The surge in commodity prices since 2021 has prompted industrial sectors to focus on higher margin products

for keeping the door open to net zero emissions by 2050 and holding global warming below 1,5 \u00b0C.", "932": "One of these pillars is to double the rate at which the energy intensity of the global economy improves.", "933": "Today the annual rate of improvement stands at about 2%.", "934": "The NZE Scenario requires this rate to double by 2030.", "935": "Decarbonizing the power and fuel sectors is crucial, but the largest emissions come from end uses and efficiency improvements are pivotal in curbing fossil fuel demand.", "936": "To achieve a doubling of energy intensity improvement, annual investment needs to triple within a little more than five years.", "937": "By 2030, investment in buildings nearly triples in the NZE Scenario , the number of heat pumps installed triples, and every new construction is net zero carbon ready.", "938": "Clean investment in transport quadruples as 70% of new cars more than half of buses and trucks sold are electric, 17 million charging points become available and new internal combustion engine vehicles are at least 20% more efficient.", "939": "While industry is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, it is also the one where funding yields the best results.", "940": "Only 6% of the total increased investment delivers 20% of the total intensity improvements by 2030.", "941": "The upcoming years are pivotal for aligning the energy system with the NZE Scenario.", "942": "Recent reductions in government support and slower growth in EV sales, heat pumps, and construction highlight the correlation between end use efficiency investment and subsidies.", "943": "However, public spending faces challenges due to inflation and higher interest rates.", "944": "The key question will be whether the business case for electrifying transport, renovating buildings, and improving industrial efficiency becomes strong enough to attract significant private sector investment.", "945": "The amount spent globally on clean energy R&D grew again in 2023, extending post pandemic gains.", "946": "A 13% rise in US government spending on energy R&D helped keep global public energy R&D spending on a steady upward trend, reaching USD 50 billion.", "947": "Energy related R&D spending in the corporate sector stood at USD 160 billion.", "948": "Although the pace of growth was slower than the two previous years, the momentum of investment in clean energy technologies was maintained, led by the automotive sector.", "949": "This growth trend is driven by three factors.", "950": "On the public side, government commitments to reduce emissions are being taken seriously, and research funding is being strategically directed to areas that still show a gap between future deployment needs and technology readiness.", "951": "Secondly, there is a fast growing recognition at the highest levels of government that clean energy technologies can offer major opportunities for investment and growth and that benefits will accrue to those offering the most competitive products.", "952": "Packages of government incentives aim to steer sectors towards low emissions options and these are spurring corporate R&D to maintain firms\u2019 competitive advantages.", "953": "These factors are evident in China, which further increased its share of energy R&D in 2023.", "954": "For smaller, innovative clean energy companies, however, 2023 was a difficult year.", "955": "The types of capital on which start ups rely , such as venture capital  or venture loans", "956": ", became significantly more expensive amid rising inflation and higher interest rates.", "957": "Not only did higher interest rates make alternative investments relatively more attractive, but inflation and weaker outlooks for consumer spending lengthened the expected time that start ups would need to reach profitability.", "958": "As a result, many investors either moved their money out of VC funds, or the funds offered smaller amounts of equity or debt to start ups , enough to keep them afloat until visibility improved.", "959": "Based on data from the first quarter of 2024, we expect start ups to find it difficult to raise capital through at least the end of 2024.", "960": "When it comes to energy innovation investment, emerging market and developing economies  remain under represented.", "961": "Considering the active role these countries need to play in energy transitions, and the greater impact of higher interest rates on the cost of capital for innovators in these countries, their limited investment participation is a concern.", "962": "In 2023, just 6% of public R&D spending and 3% of corporate R&D came from EMDE .", "963": "For start ups in some EMDE countries , where VC ecosystems are less developed than in advanced economies , borrowing rates have been reported to be as high as 25%.", "964": "However, with an 85% increase in fundraising by Indian start ups, the overall EMDE share of energy venture capital rose from 3% to 9% of the total in 2023.", "965": "Globally, public spending on energy R&D rose by 7% in 2023, to almost USD 50 billion according to our estimates.", "966": "This continues a trend that has buoyed innovation in recent years despite macroeconomic uncertainty.", "967": "However, whereas the growth in 2022 was mostly driven by spending by the Chinese government and its major energy related state owned enterprises, in 2023 nearly half the growth came from North America, especially the United States.", "968": "Collectively, budgets for US energy research at the national energy laboratories, Department of Defense and public grants given to energy R&D and demonstration projects rose by more than USD 1,3 billion in 2023.", "969": "Despite slower growth in 2023, we estimate that China exceeded the 7% per year planned increase in energy R&D spending in its 14th Five Year Plan .", "970": "This maintains China\u2019s status as the largest public spender on energy R&D.", "971": "However, compared to previous years, the share of growth in Chinese public energy R&D related to fossil fuel technologies was higher.", "972": "As a result, the global share of public energy R&D devoted to clean energy topics dipped significantly for the first time in our dataset, after stagnating in 2022.", "973": "New government initiatives in this area include Korea\u2019s List

counter cyclical government support that has been earmarked for low emissions technologies in these companies.", "983": "Major automotive manufacturers and their suppliers are an example of this situation and their receipt of sizeable public loans for electrification R&D since 2020 was explored in WEI 2023.", "984": "Another factor boosting global growth is the allocation of higher sums to energy R&D by Chinese firms.", "985": "Not only are the revenues of Chinese energy related firms rising faster than many of their international counterparts, but they also increasingly need to innovate to stay competitive domestically and internationally.", "986": "Of the top twenty energy related corporate R&D spenders in our dataset, thirteen are automotive companies based in the United

BYD and Tesla, rank thirteenth and fourteenth, respectively.", "994": "Outside the typical scope of the energy sector, corporate R&D has been rising in so called hard to decarbonise sectors such as long distance transport and heavy industry.", "995": "This is a positive sign that companies, especially in the areas of trucks and cement, are embracing the challenge of rapidly changing their long standing technological practices.", "996": "Yet for chemicals, the recent upward trend stalled in 2023.", "997": "There was no noticeable growth in annual R&D spending by companies engaged in the aviation, rail and shipping sectors.", "998": "From the perspective of financial flows, 2023 was a disappointing year for venture capital  investment in energy.", "999": "Whereas 2022 achieved unprecedented levels of deals and funding, both early and growth stage equity investment declined in 2023.", "1000": "Early stage funding, which supports entrepreneurs with technology testing and design , and plays a critical role in honing good ideas and adapting them to market opportunities , fell by 4%.", "1001": "Growth stage funding, which needs more capital but funds less risky innovation, slid 21%.", "1002": "This outcome can largely be attributed to macroeconomic conditions rather than a loss of confidence in clean energy technologies.", "1003": "With higher interest rates, fund managers found VC investments less attractive than other investment classes.", "1004": "For hardware developers, this was coupled with a more challenging path to market as their input

funding drop by more than 70% compared with 2021.", "1008": "The number of specialist VC funds targeting clean energy and other climate segments continues to grow.", "1009": "These funds are often backed by investors that impose criteria , such as potential for deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , on the use of the money, and in some cases allow returns to accrue over longer timeframes.", "1010": "This additional investor focus on energy technology innovators is one reason behind the rise in the number of early stage deals for energy start ups in 2023.", "1011": "The overall investment trend appears therefore to stem from a reduction in the amount invested per deal and a possible postponement of very large deals, especially growth equity deals.", "1012": "Such an approach may be expressed as \u201cwait and see\u201d via the provision of \u201cbridge finance\u201d , which suggests there could be an upward correction if macroeconomic conditions improve.",

magnitude to the biggest energy VC transactions in early 2023.", "1018": "In the three years to 2023, start ups based in the United States raised more than those in other regions.", "1019": "Most investors in these deals were US based.", "1020": "While China, Europe and India have consistently represented growing shares of the total as investment has increased in recent years, this is not evenly distributed between the different funding stages or among technologies.", "1021": "The share of Chinese start ups is highest in energy storage and batteries, where it now stands at 35%, while Indian start ups have been most successful in the mobility sector , including electric urban vehicles and charging infrastructure , where they represent a 6% share.", "1022": "European start ups have significantly increased their share of global energy efficiency VC funding.", "1023": "In absolute terms, the amount of money raised in 2021 2023 was nearly three times more than in 2018 2020, reaching USD 1,5 billion in 2023.", "1024": "The share of growth equity in this total has also increased, indicating greater success for European energy efficiency start ups as they scale up.", "1025": "However, across energy sectors, there has been a decline in the number of growth stage deals , when a defined product or service is in development , relative to the number of deals for early stage start ups, when the business is still being defined.", "1026": "This trend has been most visible in the North American data: Between 2016 2018, the average growth to early stage VC deal ratio was more than one growth stage deal and USD 11 of growth equity for every early stage deal and USD 1 of early stage equity.", "1027": "In the 2021 2023 period, this ratio was 0,7 growth stage deals and USD 7 of growth equity per early stage deal.", "1028": "In absolute terms, nearly three times as much funding went to early stage deals in 2023 compared to 2018, while growth stage deal value fell by 35%.", "1029": "For the first time in our dataset, European energy start ups in aggregate raised more growth equity for every early stage deal than their North American counterparts.", "1030": "The relative attractiveness of the two regions for scaling up a new energy technology, which has traditionally favoured US start ups in terms of the availability of growth equity, may be converging.", "1031": "Much of the need for clean energy technology innovation relates to the development of hardware solutions, and energy start ups developing hardware continued to attract most of the VC funding.", "1032": "However, growth stage funding for energy start ups dropped further in 2023 after a drop in 2022 and now stands at around 75% of total funding.", "1033": "Based on data for the first quarter of 2024, this level is dropping further: just 69% of growth stage VC funding was for hardware developers.", "1034": "Hardware products can take many years of VC funding to be developed to meet customers\u2019 needs, but these start ups can achieve high valuations and pay offs for investors.", "1035": "By contrast, energy software and project development companies can have a quicker path to market but offer lower returns.", "1036": "The decline in 2022 2023 likely reflects lower willingness among VC funds to make large, long term bets in the current macroeconomic environment.", "1037": "Thus, the share of hardware developers in early and growth stage deals tends to shift with changing risk perceptions.", "1038": "This indicates that governments could preferentially offer counter cyclical support to hardware developers during periods when capital is temporarily more costly.", "1039": "In a given technology area, the share of VC deals represented by project developers can indicate technology and policy maturity.", "1040": "One of the biggest deals in 2023 saw 14 different investors take USD 1,6 billion equity in H2 Green Steel, a Swedish project developer for hydrogen based steel production.", "1041": "The same company raised a further USD 300 million from three different investors in January 2024.", "1042": "The ability of H2 Green Steel to attract these levels of growth equity signals that its backers are increasingly comfortable with the level of technology risk and market outlook for hydrogen production and low emissions steel.", "1043": "In contrast, renewables project developers in 2023 attracted the smallest proportion of renewables VC investments in more than a decade .", "1044": "After 2011, when many VC investors made losses on solar companies that did not successfully scale up, there was a shift toward investment in solar project developers or companies that help building owners to install proven technologies: Between 2014 and 2018, project developers attracted more than 60% of VC investment in solar, peaking at 70% in 2018.", "1045": "This increase accompanied an industry shakeout triggered by cheaper, Chinese made crystalline photovoltaic panels.", "1046": "This was partly a reaction to how risks and innovation incentives evolve in a maturing sector.", "1047": "However, VC investors and start ups have once again shifted its focus: In 2023, owners of new solar hardware technologies received 70% of solar VC investment.", "1048": "This recent shift back to hardware shows that, even in sectors like solar, which many people consider to be a mature and stable technology, government policies can have a significant impact on innovation.", "1049": "While the trend may relate, in part, to consolidation in the market for renewable energy project developers, another factor is likely to be the renewed interest of many governments in hosting solar manufacturing facilities.", "1050": "Knowing that government support is available for setting up a production facility that can compete with imports incentivises researchers to push forward the technology frontier to compete for the domestic market.", "1051": "Start ups developing new approaches to solar photovoltaics , such as thin film, flexible designs and products that integrate solar cells , raised more VC money in 2023 than in the previous eight years combined.", "1052": "In 2023, large companies spent USD 5,5 billion buying equity stakes in smaller energy related start ups with potential strategic value for the investing firm.", "1053": "This injection of corporate venture capital  has risen dramatically in recent years, as a way for big corporations to acquire knowledge, new technologies and business models quickly and at low cost.", "1054": "The nimbleness of start ups and the \u201coptionality\u201d for investors can be particularly valuable under conditions of uncertainty, competition and budget pressures.", "1055": "While CVC remains lower than corporate R&D budgets  it has notable strategic value when disruption from mass produced, modular and quick to scale technologies is anticipated.", "1056": "For start ups, CVC complements other sources of funding and can accelerate scaling up by providing access to corporate experience and resources, especially for manufacturing, as well as access to consumers around the world.", "1057": "Apart from 2020, when the global pandemic triggered a market contraction, 2023 was the first year since 2017 that energy related CVC declined.", "1058": "This follows a broader dip in energy related VC activity in 2023, but the drop in CVC was more pronounced than the overall VC trend.", "1059": "As a result, CVC fell from 22% of total energy related VC in 2022 to 17% in 2023.", "1060": "The change was largest for early stage VC, for which CVC fell from 17% to 11% of the total.", "1061": "This raises important questions about the availability of this strategic source of capital during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.", "1062": "Two sectors that have underpinned much of the recent growth in energy related CVC , oil and gas and automotive , made cuts to their investment activities.", "1063": "For some firms, this was accompanied by messages about refocusing CVC on technologies closer to their core business and integrating start up activities with corporate strategy.", "1064": "Saudi Aramco said in January 2024 that it would increase the capital of its CVC fund and prioritise clean energy technology.", "1065": "Volvo announced it would follow some other automotive companies, such as BMW, in deepening its start up incubation and collaboration efforts, as a complement to CVC.", "1066": "In 2023, Porsche moved the headquarters of its VC fund and restructured it for efficiency.", "1067": "Increased investment by companies in industrial sectors helped to offset some of the CVC decline.", "1068": "Some of these deals were large: The Chinese aluminium firm Shandong Weiqiao Pioneering Group invested USD 1 billion in the EV maker Rox Motor the Chinese chemicals company Yibin Tianyuan Group participated in a USD 375 million round of funding for Libode New Material, a battery cathode start up and ArcelorMittal took part in a USD 120 million capital round for Boston Metal, a US iron electrolysis start up.", "1069": "Several conclusions can be drawn from the 2023 trends presented in this chapter.", "1070": "First, governments are continuing to increase spending on R&D and demonstration projects in keeping with their pledges to cut emissions while maintaining economic growth.", "1071": "Second, policies that push the private sector to adopt low emissions technologies are inducing more corporate R&D in the automotive and heavy industrial sectors.", "1072": "Third, the cost of capital matters most for early stage and smaller companies, for whom the pool of available finance has shrunk since 2022.", "1073": "It is encouraging for the prospects of addressing climate change that many governments are successfully expanding their budgets for clean energy R&D, despite competing shorter term priorities for government funds.", "1074": "Grants for applied research and demonstration projects are essential for shepherding the next generation of energy technologies to market at lower cost.", "1075": "However, governments should also be concerned by the apparent loss of momentum in equity funding for clean energy start ups, given the urgency of the challenge.", "1076": "While recent years have demonstrated that higher government ambitions and expectations for tackling climate change translate quickly into the founding of more innovative energy companies and a corresponding flow of VC capital, it has also revealed the volatility of this funding in a changing interest rate environment.", "1077": "Compared with other segments, clean energy start ups developing new hardware ideas require more capital and are often more reliant on large equity deals to pay for testing and manufacturing facilities.", "1078": "When access to this type of finance tightens, high potential technologies risk being abandoned or delayed.", "1079": "However, governments can use tools such as non dilutive project debt, equity or guarantees to accelerate the sector\u2019s transition to cheaper forms of capital for scale up.", "1080": "The VC data also shows some changes in the technology focus areas for investors, as revealed by their selectiveness in a more capital constrained environment.", "1081": "Funding for electric vehicle start ups, for example, has noticeably declined.", "1082": "Despite continued growth in electric vehicle sales, these are capital intensive firms and riskier bets when the world\u2019s largest car companies concentrate their resources on this sector.", "1083": "In comparison, VC investment continues to flow to newer areas with less dominant industrial players, including critical minerals, battery components, direct air capture of CO2, ammonia production and renewable heat.", "1084": "These areas benefit strongly from the entry of new VC investors that have exclusive mandates to support climate mitigation technologies, including hardware for challenging areas like industrial heat.", "1085": "Regionally, China is estimated to be the biggest spender on energy innovation.", "1086": "China drove the year on year growth in corporate R&D and, along with the United States, led the growth in public energy R&D.", "1087": "While the link between spending and innovation outcomes is unpredictable and not always direct, it is clear that China\u2019s increased spending on energy R&D over the past decade has borne fruit.", "1088": "China\u2019s presence is growing in the global market segments for high quality electric vehicles, batteries, heavy equipment for power plants and solar PV manufacturing.", "1089": "Each of these areas incorporates a higher share of Chinese domestic innovation than ten years ago.", "1090": "The resulting competition within global markets for clean energy technologies is positive for consumers and for accelerating energy transitions.", "1091": "However, this good news is contingent on the free flow of knowledge to stimulate further innovation, and access to markets to encourage innovators to compete.", "1092": "Governments around the world face a challenge to balance the goal of raising the global pace of energy innovation with securing a return on their R&D investments in terms of domestic economic prosperity.", "1093": "The policy toolbox for addressing this challenge includes the prioritisation of technologies that are a good fit with existing local industries, measures to support effective innovation ecosystems and innovation related to maintaining the competitiveness of manufacturing processes and high added value products.", "1094": "Except for VC fundraising, especially in India, clean energy innovation investment in EMDE did not noticeably grow in 2023 as a share of the global total.", "1095": "There is much that governments, multilateral institutions and philanthropists can do to support these countries to contribute actively to clean energy technology development.", "1096": "Domestic expertise and private sector advocates can be instrumental in helping EMDE countries to advance their energy transitions and make technology choices that fit the local context.", "1097": "As an example of how more attention to this issue has led to creative solutions, in May 2023, the International Finance Corporation took a USD 20 million equity stake in Boston Metal , a start up developing an early stage technology for low emissions steel production , which is contingent on construction of the company\u2019s first facility in Brazil.", "1098": "The United States has taken important steps to scale up investments in clean energy.", "1099": "These investments overtook the spending that went to fossil fuels in 2020 , when oil and gas investments fell sharply , and increased to USD 280 billion in 2023 from USD 200 billion in 2020.", "1100": "The country also invests a significant amount in oil and gas: for every USD 1,4 spent on clean energy in 2023, US investors directed 1 USD to fossil fuels.", "1101": " New legislative vehicles supporting clean energy investment in the United States are the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which allocated around USD 550 billion for clean energy and infrastructure, and the US Inflation Reduction Act  of 2022, which provides an estimated USD 370 billion in funding to promote energy security and combat climate change.", "1102": "These incentives are prompting faster deployment and the development of new clean energy manufacturing capacities.", "1103": "By the end of 2023, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated nearly USD 75 billion to clean energy, including projects related to grid improvement and expansion , clean energy demonstrations , energy efficiency  and clean energy manufacturing and workforce development .", "1104": "Meanwhile, tax credits from the IRA make clean energy projects in the United States more competitive and incentivise investment in vulnerable energy communities.", "1105": "The increase in clean energy investment moves capital flows towards alignment with the long term goal, announced in 2021, to achieve economy wide net zero emissions by 2050.", "1106": "However, clean energy investors have faced some headwinds, including high financing costs due to higher benchmark interest rates .", "1107": "Permitting issues and the finalisation of tax credit guidance under the IRA have also meant delays in some cases.", "1108": "The United States is the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, and its spending on fossil fuel supply , more than USD 200 billion , accounts for around 19% of the global total.", "1109": "The United States is home to around 40% of the wave of new LNG export capacity that is set to come to market in the second half of the decade.", "1110": "US spending on clean fuels is also on the rise, amid a surge of interest in opportunities for low emissions hydrogen and CCUS.", "1111": "In the IEA\u2019s Announced Pledges Scenario , lower demand for fossil fuels brings a significant reduction in upstream and midstream spending, while investments in low emissions power double and in energy efficiency nearly triple by 2030.", "1112": "Latin America and the Caribbean , a
