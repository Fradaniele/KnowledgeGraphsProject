LFP contains no nickel or cobalt became an important asset that helped reduced exposure to high commodity prices.", "217": "In addition, the emergence of CTP technology eliminated dead weight in the battery pack and enhanced the energy density of LFP.", "218": "CTP was pioneered by BYD with the Blade battery.", "219": "LFP has now become a major chemistry in 2023 with around 40% of electric car battery sales by capacity.", "220": "Due to favourable patent agreements China had been the only country producing LFP batteries after 2010.", "221": "However, the patents expired in 2022, which kick started production plans outside China.", "222": "Nevertheless, there are still major regional differences, less than 10% of total EV sales by capacity in the United States and Europe are LFP while two thirds are LFP in China.", "223": "Another major recent innovation was the first fast charging LFP battery, Shenxing developed by CATL, capable of delivering 400km of range from a ten minute charge.", "224": "This is achieved through a new electrolyte and graded anode porosities among other innovations.", "225": "The novel fast charging LFP battery will be utilised in EV vehicles this year, significantly increasing the attractiveness of LFP chemistries.", "226": "The other significant recent LFP innovation is the development and commercialisation of lithium manganese iron phosphate , the upgraded version of LFP including manganese which increases its energy density.", "227": "With CATL\u2019s M3P battery confirmed for use in six Chinese EV models and undergoing validation by Tesla for its Chinese Model 3, it is anticipated that LMFP will continue to take market share from nickel based chemistries due to its increased range.", "228": "In terms of the anode, silicon doped graphite anodes are increasing in market share with almost a third of electric car anode capacity market share.", "229": "Higher fractions of silicon are also being used with 10% silicon graphite anodes doubling in market share in 2023 to 12%.", "230": "Silicon doping increases the energy density of the graphite anode, and increased doping and higher quantities of silicon are expected in the near future.", "231": "Looking beyond lithium ion chemistries, sodium ion  batteries have experenced a surge of development in recent years, especially while lithium prices were high.", "232": "As the name suggests, this chemistry contains no lithium and also requires less critical minerals than lithium ion batteries.", "233": "Leading batterymakers including CATL, Northvolt and many others announced their sodium ion cells.", "234": "However, the fall in lithium prices has diminished the advantage of sodium ion chemistries and major ramping up plans have stalled or been delayed.", "235": "The progress of sodium ion batteries hinges on their price advantage over lithium ion, with major influence of the lithium price.", "236": "All solid state batteries  are the anticipated step change technology for battery energy density and safety.", "237": "There has been widespread industrial research and development in recent years, yet major technical challenges remain such as the typically high pressures required to ensure good electrode contact or relying on difficult to scale, expensive production processes.", "238": "Progress has been made utilising hybrid solid liquid electrolyte batteries, for instance from CATL and Quantumscape however, the use of an organic liquid electrolyte diminishes any safety advantage and may even have higher risks than conventional lithium ion batteries due to the use of lithium metal.", "239": "Progress is also being made with ASSBs, with Samsung, an industry leader in solid state, recently announcing plans for mass production in 2027.", "240": "CATL also expects to produce small scale production in the same year.", "241": "Though ASSBs hold potential in the future, they are not expected to have significant impact until after 2030.", "242": "One of the most critical considerations in the global battery outlook is the strength of manufacturing capacity in China.", "243": "China dominates the downstream battery supply chain, including processing of the battery minerals, cathode and anode material production, and battery cell and EV production.", "244": "China holds 85% of battery cell production capacity and 90% of cathode and 98% of anode material production capacity globally.", "245": "Over half of global processing for lithium and cobalt occurs in China.", "246": "The country dominates the entire graphite anode supply chain end to end.", "247": "China also produces two thirds of the world's EVs.", "248": "In almost all stages of the midstream and downstream supply chain, China has increased its market share since 2021.", "249": "China has been building battery plants and cathode and anode production capacity at a speed that exceeds projected demand.", "250": "In 2023 China\u2019s maximum cell production capacity was more than double the amount needed to meet the country\u2019s battery cell demand.", "251": "For cathode active materials, the manufacturing capacity anticipated in 2030 is about two times greater than the projected battery cell manufacturing capacity in the same year.", "252": "In the case of anode active materials, this ratio increases to five times greater, raising doubts about whether all cathode and anode material manufacturers will be able to remain competitive in the face of such a surplus.", "253": "There are several reasons for China\u2019s strong manufacturing position.", "254": "The fruits of China\u2019s industrial strategy have been seen already in many sectors including solar, aluminium and steel.", "255": "Years of government support, alongside a large and growing domestic market, have meant that the EV and battery industries in China have thrived and gained global market share.", "256": "This has now set the stage for considerable price competition and consolidation.", "257": "High technology manufacturing is now a pivotal element of China\u2019s strategy for growth.", "258": "Ample manufacturing capacity across the battery supply chain is a double edged sword.", "259": "If excess production is pushed on to export markets, battery prices and EV prices may fall, which may be good for consumers and thus support progress towards climate goals.", "260": "However, it could make difficult for producers globally to compete, increasing the level of supply concentration and exposing the supply chains to various physical and geopolitical risks.", "261": "For manufacturers in China in the coming years, the primary challenge will be to identify a sufficiently large export market to absorb their output and to improve low margins.", "262": "Conversely, there is strong pressure on manufacturers in other regions such as the European Union and the United States to improve their cost competitiveness.", "263": "The quality, cost and characteristics of cells and components provided by various suppliers, alongside local regulatory requirements and environmental, social and governance standards, will be crucial in determining how these markets develop.", "264": "The battery storage market continued its remarkable growth in 2023, with installed capacity reaching over 85 GW.", "265": "Almost half of this capacity, over 40 GW, was added in 2023 alone, another record year that saw additions doubling from 2022.", "266": "A large part of the capacity growth has come from utility scale systems, with behind the metre  battery storage responsible for about 35% of the annual additions on average.", "267": "The strong increase in capacity additions over the last few years has been driven almost entirely by China, the European Union and the United States, which collectively accounted for nearly 90% of the capacity added in 2023.", "268": "The past two years have seen China rise above the United States to become the leading market for battery storage, with its share in annual global additions rising from around 20% in 2019 to 55% in 2023.", "269": "In China, about two thirds of the additional capacity was utility scale, driven mainly by province level mandates that encourage the pairing of new solar PV or wind projects with energy storage.", "270": "BTM storage capacity grew strongly as well, with larger scale commercial rather than residential users driving the uptake, underpinned by subsidies and a rising proliferation of time of use electricity tariffs.", "271": "The United States remains the second largest battery storage market.", "272": "Utility scale projects accounted for nearly 90% of the additional capacity, with California, Texas and other states in the Southwest leading deployments.", "273": "Falling costs have allowed batteries to make inroads into ancillary service markets and they are increasingly tapped to provide balancing services and secure capacity in states with high shares of variable renewables.", "274": "Installed battery storage capacity in the European Union grew 1,7 times in 2023, with annual additions rising to nearly 6 GW.", "275": "Nearly 90% of the capacity growth was associated with BTM storage, mostly in Germany and Italy, where incentives such as tax breaks and low interest loans, as well as high retail electricity prices support the pairing of rooftop solar with storage.", "276": "In 2023, around 80% of the rooftop solar installed in Germany and Italy came with storage.", "277": "Capacity additions in Australia jumped to 1,3 GW in 2023, more than doubling last year\u2019s deployment levels, thanks in part to financial incentives that encourage the pairing of residential PV systems with batteries.", "278": "Utility scale battery storage capacity additions in Japan and Korea increased substantially in 2023, jumping to 400 MW in Japan and 300 MW in Korea.", "279": "Chile, meanwhile, added nearly 250 MW of utility scale storage in 2023, making it the first country in Latin America to deploy battery storage at scale.", "280": "In other regions, capacity additions have so far been limited.", "281": "However, in addition to further rapid acceleration in today\u2019s core markets, capacity growth is expected to broaden over the next few years.", "282": "Energy storage targets and financial support mean that India in particular has significant potential to emerge as another large market for battery storage.", "283": "Lithium ion batteries dominate the battery storage market today, accounting for more than 90% of the market.", "284": "The chemistries available for lithium ion batteries used in storage applications are the same as the ones available for the EV market.", "285": "However, storage applications have different technical needs than EVs, and characteristics such as cost, capacity to charge/discharge frequently, and lifetime are prioritised over energy density.", "286": "This has led to a shift towards LFP batteries, which accounted for about 80% of the total battery storage market in 2023, up from about 65% in 2022.", "287": "The growing battery market, together with the resurgence of LFP batteries for EV applications, is leading non Chinese battery manufacturers to develop their own LFP batteries, which today are almost exclusively produced in China.", "288": "Lithium ion battery technology is set to remain a key part of short duration  storage, but alternative technologies  are being developed either to compete or to complement it.", "289": "The critical minerals market had a turbulent year in 2023 and the main story of the year was falling prices.", "290": "Battery minerals saw particularly large declines with lithium spot prices plummeting by 75% and other key materials such as nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite seeing declines of 30 45%.", "291": "The IEA Energy Transition Mineral Price Index, which tracks a basket price of copper, major battery metals and rare earth elements, tripled in just two years starting in January 2020, but it began to slide from the beginning of 2023, returning to pre pandemic levels.", "292": "However, except for cobalt and graphite, prices remain higher than the historical averages observed in the 2010s.", "293": "In contrast, prices for copper stayed relatively resilient.", "294": "While expectations for a strong post pandemic demand recovery did not materialise at scale, actual output fell short of anticipated supply, leading to tighter market conditions, particularly for copper concentrates.", "295": "Several factors contributed to the drop in prices.", "296": "The slowing growth rate of EV battery sales, coupled with large scale cell and cathode production, has led to a substantial accumulation of downstream products in inventory.", "297": "China's expansion of battery plants, as well as cathode and anode production capacity, has far outpaced demand.", "298": "This expansion has been a key driver behind the considerable build up of inventory throughout the supply chain, resulting in reduced purchases of new materials.", "299": "Furthermore, amid record high prices in 2022, many downstream consumers also made efforts to secure ample volumes to ensure business continuity.", "300": "The rate of demand growth remained robust in 2023, with lithium demand rising by 30% and demand for nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earths expanding by 8 15%.", "301": "Clean energy applications were one of the primary contributors to this demand growth.", "302": "Across all key minerals, the share of clean energy technologies has risen consistently.", "303": "EVs cemented their position as the largest consuming segment for lithium, and increased their share considerably in the demand for nickel, cobalt and graphite.", "304": "Nonetheless, the ramp up of new supply outpaced demand growth in the past two years.", "305": "From Africa to Indonesia, and to China, new projects came online relatively quickly, adding sizeable volumes to the supply pool.", "306": "The remarkable increase in nickel supply from Indonesia is a notable example.", "307": "Overall, a combination of demand and supply side trends, alongside a correction of overly steep price rises in 2021 22 contributed to the lower price environment, which is likely to continue in 2024.", "308": "As a result, despite demand growth, the market size for energy transition minerals contracted by 10% to USD 325 billion in 2023.", "309": "It would have been 20% higher if prices had remained at 2022 levels.", "310": "Production of key energy transition minerals has expanded substantially over the past several years, easing concerns about near term supply shortages.", "311": "However, as underscored already in the IEA\u2019s first Critical Minerals Market Review in 2023, this growth has come with increasing levels of geographical concentration.", "312": "While high levels of supply concentration are well known in the critical mineral space, the issue has been exacerbated by further production increases from today\u2019s dominant suppliers.", "313": "In the case of refined materials, the share of the top three producing nations have all increased since 2020, except for lithium.", "314": "This trend is most pronounced for nickel and cobalt, where the rise of Indonesia has significantly boosted the level of supply concentration.", "315": "Between 2020 and 2023, Indonesia's share of mined nickel production increased from 34% to 52% and its share of refined nickel increased from 23% to 37%.", "316": "Meanwhile, 2023 also witnessed a proliferation of trade restriction measures, including increased Chinese controls over exports of gallium, germanium, graphite and technologies for processing rare earth elements.", "317": "For mining, however, assessing production by ownership  shows a very different picture compared with the geographical mine location.", "318": "Companies in the United States and Europe play a much greater role in the supply of all critical minerals than what the geographical location of mines may suggest.", "319": "Much of this is from some of the largest multi national mining majors such as Glencore and Rio Tinto.", "320": "Although the majority of copper production occurs in Chile, European companies are the leading copper producers with over 10% of production, with Glencore, Rio Tinto and Anglo American playing major roles, and US companies controlling the second largest amount of production.", "321": "For lithium, Australia and Chile are the primary locations of raw material production, whereas US companies such as Abermarle are a major shareholder of over 40% of producing mines.", "322": "Both nickel and cobalt also show stark differences between the geographical location of mines compared with the ownership.", "323": "Although Indonesia is the leading location of nickel mining, Indonesian companies hold less than 10% of production.", "324": "Chinese companies are the major nickel mine owners, accounting for around 40% of production.", "325": "European companies also have a sizeable share with over 20% of supply, predominantly due to operations in Indonesia owned by Eramet.", "326": "For cobalt, the majority of mines are located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , whereas European companies such as Glencore and Chinese companies such as CMOC own a third each of the supply.", "327": "Notably, DRC owned companies account for less than 5% of production.", "328": "Demand for refined copper increased by 2,7% in 2023, up from 0,9% in 2022, almost entirely driven by growing consumption in China and India.", "329": "Demand in other regions registered a modest decline.", "330": "The growth in China was predominantly underpinned by copper uses in construction and electricity networks, a trend expected to persist in the coming years.", "331": "Indications from China's 'Two Sessions' meeting in March 2024 signal a continued emphasis on expanding copper usage, particularly in renewable energy and grid expansion.", "332": "Mined copper output saw an increase of less than 2% in 2023, with notable growth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and Peru offset by declines in Chile and elsewhere.", "333": "Refined copper supply expanded by 4% in 2023, primarily driven by increased production in China, with some contributions from the DRC.", "334": "In early 2024, copper prices saw a strong increase as lower than anticipated mined output tipped the concentrate market balance toward a slight deficit, contrary to earlier expectations of surpluses.", "335": "The closure of the Cobre Panama mine and downgraded production guidance by Anglo American, Vale and Southern Copper contributed to this result.", "336": "Several supply disruptions are continuing in 2024, for example, production at the Radomiro Tomic mine in Chile was halted due to a worker strike in March.", "337": "As many smelters sought to secure copper concentrates, the spot treatment and refining charges  plummeted by 80% between October 2023 and February 2024.", "338": "In response, Chinese smelters agreed on several measures to limit the decline in TC/RCs, including replacing concentrate usage with scrap, bringing forward the schedule for maintenance, reducing utilisation rates for unprofitable facilities and postponing new projects.", "339": "The tightness in the concentrate markets extended to the scrap market as many smelters sought to increase their usage of scrap to complement concentrates.", "340": "Over recent months, there has been a noticeable uptick in China's scrap imports, with repercussions in the global scrap market.", "341": "Limited growth in mined supply is anticipated for 2024.", "342": "However, in 2025 and 2026, several new projects and expansion plans are expected to ramp up, such as Tenke Fungurume , Quebrada Blanca Phase 2  and Udokan .", "343": "These would bring additional volumes to the market but risks remain if these projects fail to meet expected growth targets or experience slower ramp ups.", "344": "Possible sanctions on Russian copper may not materially affect the market as many European companies have already diversified their supplies and a large portion of Russian volumes currently flow to China and T\u00fcrkiye.", "345": "In 2023, lithium demand rose by around 30%, maintaining the level of growth seen in 2022.", "346": "Raw material supply increased by 30% with traditional producers such as Australia and Chile being joined by new players such as Argentina and Zimbabwe.", "347": "Lithium chemical production experienced even greater expansion by 40%, primarily driven by China.", "348": "Lithium was a notable beneficiary during the price rally in 2021 and early 2022, but in 2023 it was the commodity that was most affected by price downturns.", "349": "The substantial build up of inventories in the downstream battery value chain", "350": " progressively dampened purchasing activity in 2023.", "351": "Meanwhile new supplies from Australia, Argentina and China continued to increase throughout the year, further pressuring prices.", "352": "Lithium prices fell by over 75% during the course of 2023, returning to pre pandemic levels.", "353": "This steep decline prompted various actions by producers to reduce output and scale back expansion plans.", "354": "Core Lithium decided to suspend mining operations at its Finniss mine to focus on processing stockpiled ore.", "355": "Albemarle outlined plans to reduce capital expenditures for 2024 while implementing cost cutting measures.", "356": "Talison announced a production reduction plan in response to market conditions.", "357": "Lithium prices saw a slight uptick in March April 2024, supported by production cuts and expectations for the end of the destocking cycle.", "358": "The revival of downstream activities may provide some upside for prices.", "359": "However, a significant price surge in the near term is difficult to envision.", "360": "Several potential supply sources stand ready to ramp up production, which could cap the potential for a substantial price increase.", "361": "For example, it is estimated that lepidolite assets in China currently runs at 40% utilisation rates but could return to the market if prices were to rise substantially in the short term.", "362": "Additionally, spodumene assets in China, Canada, Brazil and Africa are also positioned for robust growth.", "363": "On the chemical front, numerous lithium refineries are scheduled to commence operations and expand capacity in 2024 and 2025, primarily in Argentina, Australia and China.", "364": "Most of the recently announced supply reductions or postponements have been associated with hard rock lithium, not chemicals.", "365": "While investment and exploration activities in the lithium sector remained strong in 2023, the enduring low prices may dampen investment appetite for new greenfield projects, thereby impacting medium to long term market balances.", "366": "Nickel Nickel was another material that experienced significant price declines, with prices falling more than 40% in 2023.", "367": "Several factors, including a downstream inventory overhang, the accelerated adoption of LFP chemistries, and subdued stainless steel demand, particularly in advanced economies, contributed to this downturn.", "368": "However, the primary driver was oversupply, driven by a surge in output from Indonesia.", "369": "While demand for nickel grew by 4% in 2022 and 8% in 2023, mined nickel supply increased by 19% in 2022 and 9% in 2023.", "370": "In 2023, Indonesia\u2019s production growth was greater than global output growth, implying reduced output from other producers.", "371": "Refined nickel production expanded by 14% in 2022 and 2023 each, again led by Indonesia and China.",

contributed to notable output growth in the country.", "375": "In recent years, the proliferation of methods to convert low purity Class II products and intermediates has blurred the traditional boundary between Class I and Class II products, contributing to a decline in nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange  where high purity Class I products are traded.", "376": "With the notable discounts of nickel sulphate and NPI to the LME price, several producers in China  have begun producing higher grade nickel cathodes suitable for delivery on both the LME and Shanghai Future Exchange .", "377": "In July 2023, Huayou\u2019s nickel products were accepted by the LME, and other nickel sulphate producers such as China\u2019s GEM and CNGR are following suit.", "378": "Overall, the oversupply of Class II and intermediates in Indonesia and China and mechanisms to bring the surplus of Class II products to the Class I market coincided with weak demand, causing a sharp correction in prices.", "379": "These market conditions have taken a heavy toll on many higher cost producers, prompting them to temporarily suspend production or, in some cases, cease operations.", "380": "Panoramic Resources made the decision to halt operations at its Savannah nickel mine in West Australia.", "381": "BHP is reassessing its Nickel West operations and planned investments for the West Musgrave project in Australia.", "382": "This has sparked discussions about price premiums for nickel products with high environmental and social performance.", "383": "However, there are limited indications thus far that consumers favour products with lower environmental and social impacts .", "384": "In 2023, the nickel market saw a surplus equivalent to around 8% of annual consumption.",

throughout 2023 due to a combination of production growth from the DRC and Indonesia coinciding with weak demand.", "389": "Over the past two years, demand for cobalt has increased by 8 10% annually, while mined cobalt supply expanded by an average of 16% and refined cobalt supply by 13%.", "390": "In 2023, prices for cobalt metal performed better than those for cobalt sulphate, signalling weaker demand in the battery sector compared with demand for alloys and magnets.", "391": "The DRC, the largest supplier with a 65% market share, delivered the largest increase in production in 2023.", "392": "The ramp up of CMOC\u2019s Kisanfu mine in the DRC", "393": "exceeded expectations from the industry, and the resolution of the dispute between DRC\u2019s state owned mining company

"395": "Indonesia rapidly ascended to become the second largest producer, driven by the burgeoning production of mixed hydroxide precipitate  from its HPAL facilities.", "396": "For refined cobalt, China has dominated production volume growth over the past few years, with virtually no growth observed in other regions.", "397": "Subdued prices prompted many producers to stockpile cobalt hydroxide or metal in an effort to bolster future profitability, though the effectiveness of these measures hinges on the evolution of near term market balances.", "398": "Cobalt prices are expected to remain subdued in 2024 as supply growth continues to outpace demand growth.", "399": "While overall battery deployment continues to increase, the trend in battery chemistry choices is shifting towards those using less cobalt.", "400": "Although the pace of supply growth is anticipated to slow in 2024, significant price support in the near term is unlikely, although logistical bottlenecks or unexpected supply disruptions of large mines could trigger a brief price rally.", "401": "Graphite", "402": "In 2023, graphite consumption grew by 11% to 4,6 Mt, with battery related demand growing by 40% to 1,5 Mt.", "403": "Mining production of natural graphite has been stable, while synthetic production continued to ramp up, allowing total graphite supply to grow by 10,5% and reach 5,5 Mt.", "404":

course of 2023 with prices for natural flake graphite falling by 30% and spherical graphite by 45%.", "407": "One of the most significant developments for graphite this year is that since December 2023, natural and refined battery grade graphite are subject to export controls from China.", "408": "These are not the first set of Chinese export controls for critical minerals, with restrictive measures taken for rare earth elements in the early 2010s and for gallium and germanium since July 2023, but it is the first time these happened for a critical input of the EV supply chain.", "409": "In January and February 2024, exports to Japan and Korea , key EV anode producers outside of China , were significantly below average although they returned to normal levels in March.", "410": "In parallel, new US IRA guidance is creating incentives for a number of battery manufacturers to source graphite from outside of China.", "411": "While the market is well supplied for the moment, this

conducting feasibility studies, and in some cases these assessments are already complete.", "645": "Neither case considers projects that are in very early stages of development, or includes theoretical projects for which resources might be adequate but which have not been proposed.", "646": "For these reasons, our focus on the supply side is on the period to 2040.", "647": "Based on these two supply scenarios, we assess how today's geographical concentration evolves over time, for both mining and refining, and how expected supply compares with primary supply requirements in climate driven scenarios .", "648": "In some cases, we highlight potential gaps between expected supplies and material requirements in climate driven scenarios.", "649": "We do not attempt to close these gaps by introducing additional projects beyond those already underway or being considered.", "650": "Climate driven scenarios, the NZE Scenario in particular, reflect many demand side measures

reducing demand further.", "651": "The aim of the exercise is to provide a framework for assessing progress towards achieving global energy security and climate goals and risks that may arise along the way.", "652": "There remain considerable uncertainties over how market balances evolve in practice.", "653": "On the demand side, it should be noted that the world is not yet on track for the outcomes in the APS or the NZE Scenario doing so will require significant additional efforts by policymakers and industries alike.", "654": "Where gaps are identified between future demand and supply, these may potentially be closed by developing additional projects, scaling up recycling further, and promoting a range of material efficiency measures beyond what are already assumed.", "655": "The

concentrated, with China claiming nearly 50% of the market value in 2030.", "757": "China also sees a rise in market value for mined materials as the country's production of copper, lithium, and rare earth elements undergoes rapid expansion.", "758": "The rapidly growing demand for minerals, and the variations seen across different scenarios, raises uncertainties about future market balances, and whether future supplies can match the pace of demand growth in scenarios that meet national and global climate goals.", "759": "In recent years, substantial investments have been made in mineral supply, and an increasing number of projects have been announced, indicating an expansion in expected supply volumes in the coming years.", "760": "In some cases, such as cobalt, nickel and rare earth elements, the expected supply by 2035 from both existing and announced projects look tight, but aligns more closely with the projected demand in the APS, particularly when projects assumed in the high

lithium.", "765": "Announced projects indicate that a mined copper supply gap may develop in the current decade in the base case.", "766": "Even under the high production scenario, the anticipated supply by 2035 falls well short of meeting the APS requirements, indicating a potential necessity for a further increase in scrap utilisation, demand reduction through material substitution or technological innovation, alongside efforts to foster additional project developments.", "767": "Lithium presents another significant challenge, exhibiting a sizeable anticipated gap with climate driven needs, owing to the strong position of lithium ion batteries in EVs and storage applications.", "768": "The current downturn in prices may dampen investment appetite for new greenfield projects, which could have profound longer term implications.", "769": "Global mineral supply chains are not well diversified, as highlighted in Chapter 1, and recent progress on diversifying supply sources has been limited.", "770": "Will this picture change with the multitude of newly announced projects in recent years?", "771": "Our analysis of project pipelines suggests that the geographical concentration of mining operations is set to remain high in most cases.", "772": "The situation improves somewhat in the high production case, indicating that many projects being developed in geographically diverse regions are not among the front runners for development.", "773": "This pattern mirrors the situation in refining operations, as most refining projects are located in today's dominant producers, thus prolonging high concentration levels in refined material production.", "774": "Between now and 2030, some 70 75% of projected supply growth for refined lithium, nickel, cobalt

Concern, while the EU CRMA targets that no single country should supply more than 65% of Europe's annual consumption of any key materials .", "779": "Other major consuming countries are increasingly aligned with the objective to diversify their supply sources.", "780": "However, given that the top producing nation is responsible for a large portion of global supply for most minerals, available supply outside the largest producing country may be significantly constrained to achieve these ambitions.", "781": "We conducted the \u201cN 1 test\u201d to assess how the supply and demand landscape might appear if the largest global supplier were removed from the market.", "782": "Specifically we assessed N 1 supply and N 1 material requirements in 2030 in the APS, excluding both anticipated

non single origin minimum threshold  is applied in a global context, the N 1 nickel and cobalt supply is barely able to meet this minimum threshold.", "785": "The situation is even more pronounced for graphite.", "786": "Although there is abundant supply of graphite globally, the expected N 1 supply is entirely insufficient to meet the minimum threshold.", "787": "This indicates that without efforts to develop additional projects in geographically diverse regions, achieving the goals set by policy legislation would be challenging.", "788": "This analysis underscores the need for concerted efforts to expedite the development of promising projects located in geographically diverse regions.", "789": "Additionally, it highlights the importance of harnessing the potential for value chain expansion in major resource holders in emerging and developing economies, provided such expansion is economically viable and can yield significant economic and social advantages.", "790": "Investment across the supply chain is crucial, yet equally vital is unlocking the potential of recycling, innovation, and behavioural change.", "791": "A strong emphasis on recycling can not only diminish the magnitude of primary mineral requirements but also yield substantial security benefits for regions dependent on imported materials.", "792": "While the share of secondary supply from recycling in total demand remains modest for most focus minerals, it experiences significant growth in the NZE Scenario, particularly post 2030, as policy mandates strengthen and a substantial volume of end of life EV batteries enters the market .", "793": "Copper is the only critical mineral present in all of the most important clean energy technologies , EVs, solar PV, wind, and electricity networks , due to its unmatched combination of characteristics: electronic conductivity, longevity, ductility and corrosion resistance.", "794": "Therefore, the security of supply of copper is paramount for the energy transition.", "795": "Total copper demand is made up of a combination of refined copper demand  plus direct use of scrap .", "796": "Historically, refined copper demand has been dominated by construction and electricity networks, responsible for 30% and 15% of global demand in 2023, respectively.", "797": "Other key sources of demand include industrial machinery and equipment  and the

the rapid deployment of renewables and EVs, and a significant expansion of electricity networks.", "801": "Copper is critical for lithium ion batteries for EVs, being irreplaceable for the anode current collector, as well as being used in wiring in the battery packs and being a key component of EV motors.", "802": "Electricity networks remain the second largest source of demand after construction for the STEPS and APS, but in the NZE Scenario, it becomes the largest source of demand by 2030 before construction again overtakes to be the dominant source after 2040.", "803":

energy technologies in refined copper demand has grown modestly in recent years from 22% in 2015 to a quarter in 2023 however, this decade the share dramatically increases, reaching a third in STEPS, almost doubling to reach almost 40% in the APS and 45% in the NZE Scenario in 2030 due to the rapid deployment of renewables and EVs.", "806": "The earlier electrification of end uses and penetration of renewables requires a rapid addition of electricity networks over the period to 2040, after which the pace of expansion decelerates.", "807": "This leads to a decrease in copper demand for electricity networks between 2040 and 2050, resulting in a slight decrease in the share of clean energy technologies.", "808": "Global mined copper supply reached 22,5 Mt in 2023, up 8% from 2020.",

overtaking Peru as the second largest supplier.", "814": "The DRC copper belt is home to some of the highest grade copper resources in the world, for instance the Kamoa Kakula mine is one of the world\u2019s highest grade major copper mines, ten times the global average .", "815": "This makes capital and production costs, and emissions in the DRC significantly lower than other regions, driving a dramatic growth in supply.", "816": "China is the fourth largest producer with 8% of global supply while Russia supplies 5%.", "817": "Indonesia has seen impressive growth since 2020

supply, from 8% in 2023 to 12% in 2040.", "823": "Russia and Indonesia also continue to grow in supply share, together supplying 13% in 2040.", "824": "The growing share of supply from these countries displaces a significantly shrinking share from Peru, which drops from 12% today to 7% in 2040 due to a lack of viable projects and ageing assets.", "825": "Beyond the challenges of declining copper ore quality, there are additional pressures coming from local social and environmental opposition, particularly in Latin America.", "826": "At the end of last year, Cobre Panama, one of the largest copper mines in the world supplying 1,5% of global copper output, was shut down by the government due to widespread protests regarding environmental damage and corruption concerns.", "827": "Beyond the loss of one of the largest copper producing assets, the case is expected to deter mining investment in the country.", "828": "One of Peru\u2019s largest copper mines, Las Bambas, also saw a strike

supplying a quarter of global supply in 2023, it produces only 8% of the world\u2019s refined copper, and this share has decreased since 2015 when it was 12%.", "836": "This demonstrates that over half of Chile\u2019s mined copper concentrate is exported for refining, with the majority to China.", "837": "Copper concentrate is the number one exported product from Chile in terms of value.", "838": "Since 2012 exports of copper concentrates from Chile have increased 60% mainly to China while exports of refined copper have dropped 20% over the same period.", "839": "This decline is largely due to the decline in production from solvent extraction electrowinning  mines which directly produce refined copper from oxide ore.", "840": "As the oxide ore supply decreased, with many transitioning from processing oxides to conventional sulphide mining, its export of concentrate increased and refined copper decreased.", "841": "There are also environmental concerns which have led to the closing of smelters in Chile.", "842": "The DRC is now the joint second largest copper refiner with Chile.", "843": "While Chile has lost market share since 2015, the DRC has doubled its share

share of the top three refiners remains at the same level at around 60%.", "846": "China, however, continues to increase its dominance of copper processing, supplying around half of global refined copper from 2030 onwards.", "847": "Little change occurs for the other countries in this period.", "848": "This again creates a major dependency and vulnerability.", "849": "Countries in Latin America could prioritise the development of greater domestic processing capability.", "850": "Not only would this help diversify refined supplies of copper, it would support the countries\u2019 economies increasing their share of the value chain.", "851": "However, cost and environmental concerns are key barriers.", "852": "Smelting is not a high margin business, and increasing pressures from high labour and energy costs have made it challenging to compete with China.", "853": "Capital requirements to reduce emissions and increase the sustainability of operations add to this pressure.", "854": "Recently Chile\u2019s Codelco closed its Ventanas smelter due to pollution which resulted in a poisioning incident in the local community.", "855": "Looking at mining and refining production in 2023 by ownership  shows a different picture from production location.", "856": "Based on the analysis of top 20 companies, mining appears to be similarly diversified by ownership with a top three country owner share of 45%, the same as production location.", "857": "European companies are in fact the largest copper producers with over 20% of production.", "858": "US companies also produce almost 20% of global supply, despite little mining taking place domestically, and this is all from two companies: Freeport McMoRan and Southern Copper.", "859": "Companies from Australia and Canada are also major copper producers, together supplying 20% of production despite limited domestic supply.", "860": "In terms of refining, the picture is similar with Chinese companies dominating with 40% of production.", "861": "Top three refining countries\u2019 share by owner is the same as by location with 60%.", "862": "European companies are the second largest refiners with 20% as well as being the second largest refining location but with only 10% by geography.", "863": "Japanese companies are the third largest refiners despite being the fifth largest refining location.", "864": "Again US companies play a leading role in copper refining being the fourth largest refiners.", "865": "Declining ore quality is the most critical issue for copper, resulting in increasing capital and operating costs.", "866": "Operating costs have increased in most areas in real terms since 2020 with energy, on site, treatment and refining charges , shipment costs and reagent cost increases all being major drivers.", "867": "Capital costs have also increased significantly for new copper projects.", "868": "Recent brownfield projects have a capital intensity around USD 30 000 per tonne, whereas in real terms past brownfield projects initiated around 2017 were cheaper at around USD 20 000/tonne.", "869": "Expansions are costing more due to having to go deeper and the need to mine more waste to maintain production levels from the declining ore quality.", "870": "Greenfield projects also suffer higher costs due to the lack of high quality resources, the need to comply with higher ESG standards, challenging geology, and higher labour and equipment costs.", "871": "The recently commissioned DRC mine Kamoa Kakula, with one of the highest grade copper ore in the world, contrasts from current trends with a capital intensity around just USD 7 000/tonne, demonstrating the major cost advantages in the high grade areas of the DRC, and explaining its rapid rise in supply.", "872": "Adding to the supply pressures from the declining ore quality are various disruptions to copper supply .", "873": "The global disruption rate in copper supply has been consistent around 5% of the original targeted production.", "874": "At a global scale, the primary causes vary considerably with the leading causes being technical issues, slow ramp up, and grades being lower than anticipated.", "875": "Strikes have been a less critical issue over recent years however, in 2017 they resulted in exceptional disruption due to strikes at the world\u2019s largest mine Escondida in Chile.", "876": "In 2020, Covid 19 was the primary cause of supply issues.", "877": "Regionally, the picture varies considerably.", "878": "Averaged over the past seven years, Oceania  has the highest apparent disruption rate over 6% of anticipated production, while Africa has had the lowest with 4%.", "879": "However, in both regions technical disruptions are responsible for a higher share of disruption than the global average.", "880": "Oceania has also been disproportionately affected by weather related issues.", "881": "Copper scrap falls under two broad categories.", "882": "High grade or No. 1 scrap, known as direct use of scrap, is directly used by semi manufacturers supplementing their cathode supply as a source feed.", "883": "There is also lower grade No. 2 scrap, which contains greater impurities and is used by smelters and refineries.", "884": "The higher impurities prevent this scrap from being used directly.", "885": "Looking at historical secondary supply correlations with copper price shows they are strongly correlated with little lag, thus the price strongly determines secondary supply, which acts as a market balancing mechanism.", "886": "This demonstrates that ramping up secondary supply can happen quickly and reactively with the right incentives.", "887": "Therefore, secondary supply can be an increasingly important source of copper supply particularly in times of supply shocks and price spikes, if the right policy incentives are in place.", "888": "However, this also shows the difficulty in sustaining high scrap usage rates in a low price environment.", "889": "Copper scrap use has decreased since 2015 from 18% to 17% of demand excluding direct use of scrap, and more significantly including direct scrap .", "890": "This is due to a combination of price, scrap trade restrictions from China, higher energy and shipping costs reducing recycling profitability, the impact of Covid 19, and that EU and US policies promoting domestic scrap collection have not yet taken effect.", "891": "In climate driven scenarios, however, copper scrap use increases significantly.", "892": "In the NZE Scenario, the share of secondary supply in total demand rises to 20% by 2030 and 30% in 2040, excluding direct use of scrap.", "893": "This growth is driven by strong policy efforts to increase collection rates, optimise sorting systems, raise policy mandates for recycling and encourage investment in new processing facilities and smelters.", "894": "Growing end of life volumes from EV batteries also emerge as a major contributor from 2030.", "895": "In the NZE Scenario, both sources of secondary supply experience strong growth, with direct use of scrap almost doubling from 2023 to 2040 while secondary production scrap increases by 2,5 times in the same period.", "896": "Our analysis of project pipeline indicates that a copper primary supply shortfall may develop after 2025 in all three scenarios, despite the signficant growth in secondary supply.", "897": "Even in the high production case where almost 2 Mt of extra mined supply is available shows a supply gap of 2,2 Mt  to meet demand required by government climate pledges while there is a 4,5 Mt  shortfall to match demand in the NZE Scenario in 2030.", "898": "This demonstrates the urgency of financing and approving new supply projects given the long lead times to bring online new production.", "899": "Beyond 2030 the supply gaps continue to expand as demand grows robustly for all scenarios.", "900": "By 2040, base case supply would have to increase by 80% to meet APS demand while it would have to double to be on track to meet 1,5\u00b0 C by 2050.", "901": "Even in the high production case, supply would have to increase by 60% in the APS and 75% in the NZE Scenario by 2040 to meet demand.", "902": "This anticipated primary supply deficit presents a growing concern for future clean energy technology deployment.", "903": "The most critical risk for copper is this major supply gap from 2030 onwards, being primarily driven by the strong increase in demand from clean energy technology deployment coupled with the declining ore quality in resources.", "904": "For instance, the average grade of copper concentrate in Chile has decreased 30% since 2005.", "905": "Although the implied supply gaps do not mean that achieving transition goals are unattainable, the substantial supply deficit requires a range of solutions to reduce pressure on primary copper supply requirements.", "906": "This includes considerable supply and demand actions from governments and companies, including investment, substitution, material efficiency and recycling measures.", "907": "The lack of diversification going forward, particularly in refining is also a key risk for the security of supply of copper.", "908": "Supply measures", "909": "First, on the supply side it is essential to stimulate significant investment in new primary supply, including in lower grade plays.", "910": "Governments can play a key role in supporting strategic projects financially and in streamlining permitting.", "911": "However, the problem of declining ore quality poses a considerable challenge on the investment side, as there are few major new resources of high quality to exploit, also as a result of subdued exploration spending over the past decade.", "912": "The tight supply market is likely to increase prices which could support investment in lower grade plays, but pose economic pressures on end users.", "913": "Many projects in the largest supply region, Latin America, which is also the region facing acute water stress challenges, are also facing critical social and environmental opposition, which has already resulted in the shutdown of the Cobre Panama mine.", "914": "This underlines the importance of governments and international mining companies working closely with the local community and ensuring benefits are felt to maintain social acceptability.", "915": "Recycling is one of the most crucial measures to reduce primary copper supply pressure going forward.", "916": "Copper is one of few materials that can be recycled repeatedly without any loss of quality.", "917": "Manufacturing scrap is already reasonably well recycled however, end of life scrap and mining waste have significant potential for improvement.", "918": "With global copper secondary supply currently 17% of demand , but increasing to 30% in 2040 in the NZE Scenario, there is still substantial room for improvement.", "919": "Given its multitude of applications, the global stock of copper is a critical resource, often referred to as the \u201curban mine\u201d, and further exploitation of this is crucial.", "920": "One of the critical issues limiting copper recycling is the difficulty in economically sorting and separating copper and its alloy types from complex electronic post consumer scrap, where the value of recovered copper is often not high enough to match the recycling cost.", "921": "Second, collection infrastructure is often insufficient in many regions, with limited coordination between supply chain actors.", "922": "This is compounded by insufficient incentives and information for consumers to recycle copper containing products.", "923": "Lastly, there is a lack of regulatory mandates on copper recycling and collection.", "924": "To address these challenges and enhance copper recycling, several actions are necessary.", "925": "First, implementing comprehensive regulations is pivotal, including recycling rates and content mandates, bans on metals in landfills, and enforcement of design for recycling standards for new products to ensure a larger pool of products that are economically recyclable.", "926": "Governments can support copper recycling supply chain coordination, which can reduce costs.", "927": "Policy measures including China\u2019s \u201cGreen Fence\u201d policy, restricting the import of low quality copper scrap, has inadvertently resulted in scrap oversupplies in Europe and thus low quality scrap not being accepted in recent years.", "928": "Therefore, increasing the scrap pool without accompanying investment in processing facilities may be less effective.", "929": "This reinforces the need for greater global coordination between copper recycling supply chain actors, coupled with improved tracking of global scrap flows.", "930": "Second, governments can support and scale up collection and sorting infrastructure, including information campaigns and incentives for consumers.", "931": "Third, support for novel emerging recycling technologies which can efficiently sort and separate copper and its alloys is crucial, for instance sensor based scrap sorting such as X ray fluorescence and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.", "932": "Lastly, supportive trade policies and measures promoting the development of new processing capabilities, along with economic incentives aimed at sustaining higher scrap usage in times of lower prices, are essential.", "933": "Novel technologies offer promise for extracting greater amounts of copper from lower grade plays and materials currently considered waste.", "934": "For instance, primary sulphide leaching, bioleaching or hydrometallurgy can enable copper recovery from ores below mill head grade, typically considered waste.", "935": "Advanced separation techniques can also concentrate and upgrade low quality ore.", "936": "Machine learning has also been used not only to optimise processing operations but also in identifying new resources.", "937": "Despite their promise, many of these technologies are still emergent and have to be proven at scale.", "938": "On the demand side, there are multiple measures which can be taken to relieve supply pressure.", "939": "Increasing material efficiency is key to reducing copper demand.", "940": "For instance setting mandates and standards for copper intensity in products such as construction pipes or wiring can be effective.", "941": "Providing financial incentives for consumers to purchase high material efficiency products can also help, particularly in appliances.", "942": "Copper intensity is being reduced in products such as electric motors and solar panels, where price is often a driver.", "943": "Substitution of copper where possible is an important measure going forward.", "944": "Aluminium, though it has 60% of the electronic conductivity of copper, is the primary substitute option for many copper applications.", "945": "It is also lower cost and lighter weight providing other potential advantages.", "946": "There are applications where copper cannot be substituted including lithium ion anode current collectors, due to lithium alloying with aluminium at low potentials.", "947": "In networks aluminium\u2019s lower electrical conductivity requires thicker cables, while the inferior thermal and mechanical properties necessitates greater maintenance, therefore, aluminium is less suitable for high voltage subsea and underground cables .", "948": "However, in many applications substituting copper is possible with commercial viability with minimal disadvantage.", "949": "For instance, copper plumbing can often be replaced by plastic pipes such as cross linked polyethylene  or high density polyethylene , though they can be difficult to recycle.", "950": "Aluminium can replace overhead copper distribution cables, as well as copper windings in some motors, generators and transformers.", "951": "However, it is also important to note aluminium processing is almost five times more carbon intensive than copper processing therefore, there are energy related implications to substituting copper with aluminium.", "952": "Lithium is used in a variety of applications such as ceramics or lubricants, as well as in small volumes in pharmaceuticals, but demand structure has deeply transformed over the last ten years, making batteries the dominant driver of global lithium demand growth.", "953": "Lithium, one of the lightest metals in the periodic table, is the natural candidate for high energy density in batteries due to its superior electrochemical characteristics.", "954": "Lithium demand is set to rise almost threefold over this decade in the STEPS, expanding faster than all other focus minerals.", "955": "By 2050, demand reaches 1 200 kt Li in the STEPS and 1 600 kt Li in the APS.", "956": "In the NZE Scenario, demand increases to 1 700 kt Li by 2050, a tenfold growth from today\u2019s levels, driven by clean energy technologies.", "957": "Not only is lithium critical to clean energy transitions, but the lithium industry\u2019s ability to ramp up has allowed the EV industry to outpace industry expectations.", "958": "The EV industry contributes to about 90% of future lithium demand growth between today and 2050 in the APS.", "959": "Meeting the 1,5 \u00b0C climate objective requires particularly rapid growth this decade: in 2030, the EV sector\u2019s annual lithium demand is 40% higher in the NZE Scenario than in the APS.", "960": "Battery storage is currently a minor consumer of lithium, accounting for about 5% of demand, but its development accelerates by the end of the decade.", "961": "In the NZE Scenario, lithium demand for battery storage rises to 130 kt Li in 2050, well over ten times the current demand.", "962": "Lithium ion batteries\u2019 role in fuelling the growth of the EV industry remains unchallenged in the near term.", "963": "Alternative technologies such as sodium ion batteries and vanadium flow batteries begin to take some shares from lithium ion batteries in low range vehicles and storage markets, but they do not materially alter the prospects for lithium demand in climate driven scenarios.", "964": "In an alternative case of the NZE Scenario where sodium ion experiences wider popularity within the EV market, total lithium demand could be reduced by 10% in 2030.", "965": "Likewise, in the case of an early adoption of vanadium flow technologies, demand for lithium in storage applications could be reduced by 6%.", "966": "If technical challenges around their scale up are overcome, solid state batteries with lithium metal anodes could create a new market for lithium in metal form , of 200 kt Li in 2040 and 330 kt Li in 2050 in the NZE Scenario.", "967": "Today, annual production of lithium raw materials  amounted to around 190 kt Li in 2023, 70 kt Li from brines and 120 kt Li from hard rock.", "968": "Lithium production has more than doubled in the past three years.", "969": "The dominant producer of hard rock lithium is Australia, which produces 84 kt Li in the form of spodumene concentrate, mostly exported to China for refining.", "970": "Another type of hard rock ore, lepidolite, is being developed, with a boom of production during the high price period of 2021 2023 in China\u2019s Jianxi province, providing 12 kt Li to the market in 2023.", "971": "Brines are extracted in salt lakes of Latin America , but also from high plateaux in western China .", "972": "Analysis of announced

alloys : in 2015, 75% of nickel\u2019s total demand was for alloys.", "1052": "However, from 2020 to 2023 this shifted substantially and demand from the clean energy sector became the main factor behind a 30% increase in overall nickel demand over this period.", "1053": "This was primarily due to the increasing use of nickel rich EV batteries, but was also driven by the use of nickel in low

all scenarios, clean energy technology\u2019s share in total demand continues to rise, peaking at around 40% in the STEPS and around 55% in the APS and NZE Scenario by 2040 before falling slightly due

approximately ninefold between today and 2050 in the APS and NZE Scenario.", "1060": "There are two types of nickel ore: laterite and sulphide.", "1061": "Laterite ores are primarily found in Indonesia, New Caledonia, the Philippines, and Australia, and sulphide ores are primarily found in Australia, Canada, Russia, and China.", "1062": "Over the last five years, nickel mining has experienced significant absolute increases in the amount of material mined, as well as a shift in the type of ore mined.", "1063": "From 2018 to 2023, mined nickel supply increased by almost 1,5 times from 2,4 Mt to 3,5 Mt.", "1064": "This increase was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of mining in Indonesia, which saw a tripling in mined nickel output between 2018 and 2023, rising from just 0,6 Mt in 2018 to 1,8 Mt in 2023.", "1065": "Increases were also seen in Brazil, New Caledonia and Canada.", "1066": "There has also been an increasing shift in the type of nickel ore, moving away from historically mined nickel sulphide to laterite.", "1067": "From 2018 to 2023, laterite mining nearly doubled from 1,5 Mt to 2,8 Mt, whereas sulphide mining fell slightly from 0,8 Mt to 0,7 Mt.", "1068": "This led to the share of laterites in total supply growing from 65% to 80%.", "1069": "In our base case, this trend is expected to continue until it reaches almost 90% in 2040, primarily driven by the growth in nickel mining in Indonesia, which almost doubles over the same period.", "1070": "The mined nickel market has been increasingly geographically concentrated since 2018, with Indonesia\u2019s share of global production increasing from 25% in 2018 to 52% in 2023.", "1071": "Looking ahead, in the base case, mined nickel supply is expected to continue growing to 4,4 Mt by 2040, marking a one third increase from today.", "1072": "As our high production case assumes several early stage projects come online, mined nickel supply grows to around 6 Mt by 2040, almost doubling.", "1073": "Geographical concentration is set to increase further in the base case, with the top three producing countries' share rising from 70% today to 83% by 2040.", "1074": "However, in the high production case, more projects come online from diversified regions, notably Australia and Brazil, bringing the top three countries' share slightly down to 81% by 2040.", "1075": "In the near term, there could be some oversupply in the mined nickel market as a result of high investment into nickel developments in the last five years.", "1076": "In the longer term, expected supply from announced projects in the base case may fall short of meeting primary supply requirements in both the STEPS and APS by 2030.", "1077": "Additional projects that are assumed to come online in the high production case will need to materialise in this case.", "1078": "In the NZE Scenario, planned and high potential projects fall short of primary supply requirements by 2030, requiring new projects to come through.", "1079": "There are two types of primary nickel products: high purity Class 1 products  and lower purity Class 2 products .", "1080": "Battery cathodes need nickel sulphate, which has historically been produced from Class 1 products.", "1081": "There are many stages of the supply chain to produce both Class 1 and Class 2 products.", "1082": "Intermediate products such as mixed hydroxide precipitate  or mixed sulphide precipitate", "1083": " are produced through hydrometallurgical processes such as bioleaching, and nickel matte is produced through smelting.", "1084": "Primary products such as nickel metals and nickel oxides, nickel pig iron  and ferronickel are produced through processes such as blast furnaces and electric arc furnaces, which can be used in end use markets as final products.", "1085": "This section refers to the latter when discussing refined products.", "1086": "Similar to nickel mining, refined nickel production has significantly increased over the last five years.", "1087": "From 2018 to 2023, refined nickel products grew 1,4fold to 3,1 Mt, primarily driven by growth in Indonesia, which saw an almost fivefold increase in production.", "1088": "Geographical concentration of the top producing country, Indonesia, grew from 30% to 45%, whereas geographical concentration of the top three producers grew from 50% to 70%.", "1089": "Looking ahead, analysis of the project pipeline indicates that refined nickel production continues to grow in the base case, to 3,9 Mt in 2040.", "1090": "The largest driver of this growth is in NPI and nickel metals, each growing by around a quarter to 2040.", "1091": "This production is primarily driven by Indonesia, which sees an over 1,5 fold increase in refined nickel product production to 2040, primarily in the form of NPI, ferronickel and nickel metals.", "1092": "The top producing country , Indonesia , continues to maintain a dominating market share, growing from 45% in 2023 to 59% in 2040.", "1093": "The high production case does not see a much higher refined nickel supply.", "1094": "While there is slightly more production in countries outside of the dominant producer, such as Australia, the level of concentration barely changes compared with the base case.", "1095": "For use in EV batteries, nickel needs to be further processed into nickel sulphate, which is then used as input into battery cathodes.", "1096": "Historically, nickel sulphate has been obtained through refining sulphide ores into nickel matte or nickel metals and oxides pellets and then into battery grade nickel as it requires high content nickel.", "1097": "Recent nickel market developments, including high prices and Indonesia\u2019s rise in prominence within the supply chain, have led to using MHP and MSP, sourced from laterite ores, as inputs for nickel sulphates.", "1098": "There has also been a rise in converting NPI and ferronickel , typically used in stainless steel applications , into nickel matte, which is then processed into nickel sulphate.", "1099": "From 2018 to 2023, the most significant increase in inputs for nickel sulphate production was from matte via sulphide ores.", "1100": "Over the same period, there was also a rise in the production of nickel sulphate from matte via laterite ore and the intermediate MHP derived from laterite ore.", "1101": "In the base case, we anticipate this shift towards utilising matte via laterite and intermediates from laterite ores to continue through 2030.", "1102": "There is also large growth in the utilisation of a mix of inputs into nickel sulphate production, with the largest absolute increase seen in a combination of Class 1 and laterite ore inputs, through either MHP or matte.", "1103": "Mixes combining Class 1 and recycled material or scrap also increase to 2030.", "1104": "In our high production case, while slightly more sulphate projects that utilise matte via sulphide may come online, the primary input drivers are expected to remain as laterite ore inputs.", "1105": "The surge in processing laterite ore for nickel sulphate production has been chiefly propelled by Indonesia, and the country is poised to maintain its leading role in driving growth in this sector.", "1106": "In the base case, Indonesia sees an over twofold increase in MHP production and an increase of 1,4 times in matte production by 2030.", "1107": "In the near term, nickel sulphate may be adequately supplied to 2025.", "1108": "However, in both the APS and NZE Scenario, nickel sulphate requirements exceed expected sulphate supply from announced projects by 2030 and beyond, even with increases in sulphate supply from secondary production as more EV batteries are deployed and recycled.", "1109": "However, new sulphate capacity can be introduced relatively quickly , within 18 24 months , and we expect that supply can be relatively responsive to developments within the EV battery industry.", "1110": "The recent low price environment for nickel prompted several nickel producers to implement cost cutting measures at existing operations.", "1111": "For instance, First Quantum's nickel mine announced production cuts, while BHP's Nickel West operations reduced its workforce.", "1112": "Additionally, other producers, such as Glencore's Koniambo nickel mine, placed their operations into care and maintenance.", "1113": "Consequently, nickel production in 2023 was lower than anticipated, with announced nickel mining production cuts and closures totalling around 80 kt.", "1114": "While the continuation of low nickel prices supports the growth of the EV market by keeping battery prices low, there is a potential downside: it may lead to further closures of nickel mines or halt ongoing developments.", "1115": "Operations such as BHP's Nickel West are contemplating putting their mines under care and maintenance, while New Caledonia's production faces the risk of investor loss.", "1116": "Reports have surfaced of producers halting project development due to nickel's low price, which threatens the long term profitability of projects such as IGO's Cosmos nickel project.", "1117": "This risk of closure and development halts is especially pronounced for projects with higher costs and lower margins, often located in regions beyond the current dominant producers.", "1118": "We have identified approximately 25 operating or potential mines that could be at risk if the current low nickel price persists, primarily located in Canada and New Caledonia.", "1119": "While closures of these nickel mines and production cuts may not immediately result in a significant undersupply of mined nickel, given that the market is currently well supplied, they could lead to a shortfall in supply compared with medium to long term demand in the APS and NZE Scenario.", "1120": "The total supply loss would be around 360 kt of supply in 2030 and 280 kt in 2040, respectively, almost 10% of supply in each year.", "1121": "The larger concern stemming from the continuation of the current low price environment is the potential closure of high cost nickel mines, which would further reduce the diversity of supply in an already geographically concentrated market.", "1122": "If all at risk nickel mines were to close, this would increase Indonesia's market share \u2014 the top nickel mining country \u2014 and the top three countries\u2019 share by around 6 percentage points in both 2030 and 2040.", "1123": "In both the base case and high production case, Indonesia\u2019s role in the global nickel market continues to expand as the country boosts its mining, refining and nickel sulphate production capacities.", "1124": "Indonesia\u2019s laterites ores are converted into nickel ready for conversion to battery grade nickel by two methods: through processing to MHP or MSP through hydrometallurgical processes such as HPAL or the production of ferronickel or NPI through electric furnaces such as RKEFs, which is then converted into nickel matte.", "1125": "Emissions per tonne of nickel vary by processing method.", "1126": "Currently, the emissions intensity of nickel production is estimated to be about 65 t CO2 e to 105 t CO2 e for RKEF and 10 t CO2 e to 60 t CO2 e for HPAL depending on the source of electricity and thermal energy or reductant utilised.", "1127": "These variations between processes primarily stem from the higher energy intensity of the laterite to NPI via RKEF process, which requires more electricity , around 500 kWh more per tonne of feed , as well as a greater direct use of carbon intensive chemical reductants and heat energy sources.", "1128": "In 2023, the primary production route of nickel in Indonesia was RKEF , which accounts for almost 90% of production, resulting in an estimated 150 Mt CO2 emissions from nickel production in the country.", "1129": "In both supply cases, operational ramp ups and new projects in Indonesia lead to a shift in the production mix towards less energy intensive processes.", "1130": "By 2030, the share of RKEF production is projected to decrease to around 80%, remaining stable through 2040.", "1131": "Meanwhile, HPAL is expected to increase its share of the production mix to approximately 15% by 2030.", "1132": "Additionally, OSBF processes also see a growing role, rising from 2% of the production mix in 2023 to 6% by 2030 in the base case.", "1133": "This transition away from RKEF towards less energy intensive processes could, on its own, lead to a reduction in the overall CO2 intensity per tonne of refined nickel in Indonesia, from around 80 t CO2 per tonne to around 75 t CO2 per tonne by 2030.", "1134": "Despite this decrease in average intensity, if Indonesia\u2019s power and thermal energy sources for nickel processing remain dependent on coal, as they do today, absolute CO2 emissions from nickel refining could be 1,4 higher in 2030 and 1,6 times higher in 2040, compared with 2023.", "1135": "Indonesia is working to shift its energy mix to cleaner sources, which, in line with a long term goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2060, could help to reduce the carbon impact of the country\u2019s nickel production.", "1136": "There are indications of some near term progress by industry players.", "1137": "For example, one company is developing several HPAL projects while exploring replacement of coal with lower emissions alternatives such as gas and bioenergy.", "1138": "However, significant work remains to lower the carbon footprint of nickel operations, with measures that address energy demand requirements and emissions from power, chemical and thermal energy processes.", "1139": "As an illustration, if the Indonesian production processes projected in this report\u2019s base case were to reduce their CO2 intensity to the \"best case\" levels identified in the Minviro paper, which assumes that processing operations utilise renewable electricity and, where possible, non coal thermal energy and reductants, their average CO2 intensity would decline by 25% .", "1140": "Absolute CO2 emissions would be similar to today\u2019s levels in 2030 and 20% higher in 2040 than today, despite the almost 65% increase in production.", "1141": "Moreover, refining and processing operations often cause air, land and water pollution, in addition to significant carbon emissions, and there are trade offs between the two commonly used processes for converting laterite ores to intermediates for battery grade nickel.", "1142": "The process of using HPAL results in high waste production but has lower emissions intensity, whereas RKEF results in less waste but extremely high carbon emissions.", "1143": "There are other environmental issues that could arise from Indonesia\u2019s growing role in the nickel market.", "1144": "The shallow, open pit mining methods used in Indonesian nickel production have led to significant deforestation and the clearing of farmland.", "1145": "Research estimates that the direct land footprint of nickel mining in Indonesia amounts to 42 m2 per tonne of nickel contained in ore.", "1146": "Under the base case production, this would equate to around 800 km2 of additional land use impact between today and 2030.", "1147": "In addition, tailings management associated with HPAL production is a persistent issue.", "1148": "While initial proposals for deep sea tailings placement were dropped over environmental concerns, the alternative, land based dry tailings stacking, still faces technical challenges driven in part by Indonesia\u2019s warm and humid climate.", "1149": "Hydrometallurgical waste from HPAL plants can be neutralised, dried and compacted by lining with geotextiles or thick clay layers to prevent waste stream leakage.", "1150": "However, significant investments in drainage and filtration systems are required to mitigate the impacts of high rainfall.", "1151": "One of the main drivers behind high emissions intensity of Indonesia\u2019s nickel is the reliance of the country\u2019s power on fossil fuels, especially coal, which make up 81% of the on grid electricity mix.", "1152": "Approximately a quarter of current coal generated power in the country is not grid connected, known as \u201ccaptive power\u201d, and serves energy intensive industries, especially minerals processing, which are viewed as important to realising Indonesia\u2019s industrial strategy.", "1153": "Coal plants integrated with industries that support value addition in the natural resources sector or have a major contribution to job creation and/or national economic growth are exempted from the moratorium on development in Perpres No. 112/2022.", "1154": "Over the last ten years, Indonesia has seen an increase in captive coal power capacity, which rose nearly eightfold from 1,4 GW to 10,8 GW.", "1155": "Without a shift in the business plans, technology choices and regulation of such plants, growth is likely to continue, with estimates of the pipeline for new captive coal power ranging from 14,4 GW to over 20 GW by 2030.", "1156": "Around two thirds of existing captive coal plants service the operating nickel smelters in the country, which are located in places that are not well integrated with the grid connected power system.", "1157": "Growth in smelter capacity and captive power to support it was driven in part by the country\u2019s export ban of nickel ores in 2020.", "1158": "In Central Sulawesi, the location of the Morowali Industrial Park, there is almost 1 Mt of production capacity and about 2,7 GW of captive coal power in operation, with a further 2,8 GW under construction.", "1159": "The locations of many of the other nickel refining operations in the country , Obi Island and Weda Bay , also have many operating and planned captive power operations.", "1160": "To prevent a substantial rise in CO2 emissions as nickel production expands, Indonesia will need to accelerate the uptake of low emissions alternatives to captive coal power and find ways to phase out existing captive coal plants, as part of an overall strategy to shift Indonesia\u2019s nickel sector to a low emissions pathway.", "1161": "The Just Energy Transition Partnership plans to develop a study on transitioning the captive power sector, building on Perpres No. 11/2022.", "1162": "Indonesia also released an Indonesian Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance which incorporates provisions for financing coal plants, aiming to expedite their closure.", "1163": "However, according to the taxonomy, new captive coal plants may be classified as a transition asset, and thus still eligible for finance, if involved in the processing and mining of critical minerals for the energy transition, such as nickel.", "1164": "As low cost, high emissions Indonesian nickel has come at scale to the global nickel market, market stakeholders have called on policy makers to support pricing mechanisms that can support the market for more sustainably produced nickel.", "1165": "However, the London Metal Exchange  rejected calls to create traded contract specifications that would support a price premium for low emissions or responsible nickel, citing concerns about market liquidity and interest as well as a lack of an agreed definition of \u201cgreen.\u201d", "1166": "Instead, the LME has highlighted its partnership with Metalshub, a digital platform for metals procurement and trading, as a way to help market participants assess potential premiums for \"cleaner\" nickel.", "1167": "Metalshub, in collaboration with a consultancy Minviro, plans to integrate nickel\u2019s carbon footprint data into the Metalshub procurement platform.", "1168": "While Metalshub does not play an active role in facilitating price determination in the way that an exchange like LME does, its recent announcement to begin reporting volumes of low carbon Class 1 nickel could contribute to market based price discovery for a \u201cgreen premium.\u201d", "1169": "LME and Metalshub have defined \u201clow carbon\u201d nickel as having a carbon footprint lower than 20 t CO2 e.", "1170": "Similarly, Fastmarkets and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, price reporting agencies, have proposed launching price assessments to distinguish cleaner nickel.", "1171": "The Fastmarkets specification would use self reported transaction data to identify whether, and at what levels, the market is paying a premium for nickel briquettes with a carbon footprint of less than 18 t CO2 e, whereas Benchmark\u2019s assessment considers transaction data for nickel sulphate sourced from companies assessed to be \u201cindustry leading\u201d within their proprietary ESG scoring system.", "1172": "The Fastmarkets and Metalshub emissions thresholds would exclude ferronickel and NPI production due to their relatively high carbon footprints but may still allow some production from HPAL pathways.", "1173": "However, it should be noted that the non emissions environmental impacts associated with HPAL routes may require a more holistic view of sustainability that goes beyond the carbon footprint alone.", "1174": "Despite efforts by market participants, it is difficult to imagine a significant premium emerging voluntarily, at least at a level that would support higher cost producers to restart or maintain production.", "1175": "Processing and manufacturing industries are sensitive to raw material input prices, and voluntarily paying above market price for feedstock is likely to significantly impact their competitiveness.", "1176": "Regulatory intervention may need to play a key role in incentivising the production and consumption of responsibly sourced materials.", "1177": "Subsidies or tax credits could be used to support the production of responsibly sourced nickel, with those provided under existing provisions such as the Inflation Reduction Act given only to producers that source a certain percentage of their nickel supply from \u201cresponsibly sourced\u201d supplies or whose upstream greenhouse gas emissions are below a certain threshold.", "1178": "In addition to its nickel finance assistance programme, Australia is considering introducing nickel production tax credits similar to those in the IRA, which considers giving a production tax credit of 10% to critical minerals producers.", "1179": "Such tax credits might be tied to emissions, giving preferential rates to low emissions producers.", "1180": "Pricing differentiation between different sources of nickel could also be established through carbon pricing and trading schemes.", "1181": "The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism , which imposes a carbon tax on imported energy intensive goods, could be expanded to include other raw materials such as nickel or the embedded emissions in downstream products, such as stainless steel.", "1182": "Disclosure policies, such as the EU Battery Regulation which by 2025 will mandate battery producers to disclose the complete carbon footprint of EV batteries over their life cycle, could also make it easier for purchasers and consumers to determine the emissions of different nickel sources, which could support voluntary adoption.", "1183": "At a minimum, all these actions would require policy makers to develop criteria to distinguish between supplies based on ESG performance.", "1184": "Establishing a common understanding of what supplies should be prioritised would require collaboration among industry stakeholders, policy makers and environmental experts to develop a robust and widely accepted framework that takes into account not only greenhouse gas emissions but also other environmental and social impacts across the supply chain.", "1185": "All of these policies and industry actions should ensure that producers follow the principle of additionality, ensuring that product emissions are meaningfully reduced over the longer term.", "1186": "Calculations of emissions also need to be meaningful and across the supply chain, avoiding \u201cgreenwashing\u201d.", "1187": "Policy makers can support this by creating regulations that mandate reporting and disclosure requirements for emissions.", "1188": "Examples include the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program  which requires large metal manufacturing facilities to report their emissions annually under specific methodologies that incorporate those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .", "1189": "On the demand side, industry can also take actions to start incentivising responsible sourcing.", "1190": "For example, the First Movers Coalition aims to leverage the collective purchasing power of major market participants to create early markets for low emissions steel, aluminium, cement, etc.", "1191": "By committing to purchase a proportion of their future supply from low emissions sources, coalition members aim to send a demand signal to incentivise clean material production at scale.", "1192": "This type of approach could also be taken on a bilateral basis by industry players in the downstream EV market.", "1193": "Some of these players have already showed a preference for low emissions nickel, such as Vale\u2019s long term offtake agreement with Tesla, which emphasised secure access to low emissions nickel.", "1194": "Cobalt demand has grown strongly in recent years, with traditional usage supplemented by uses in EV batteries.", "1195": "In 2023, the non clean energy technology sector accounted for around 70% of total consumption, while EV batteries accounted for the remainder.", "1196": "Within the non clean energy sector, portable batteries used in electronics represented the largest share.", "1197": "Although absolute demand sees a slight uptick, its proportion of total cobalt demand diminishes to 25% by 2040 in both the APS and NZE Scenario.", "1198": "Cobalt demand for

cobalt consumption by the end of this decade, and their share rises to 60% by 2040 in the NZE Scenario.", "1201": "While demand for EV batteries continues to rise, the recent trend towards low cobalt or cobalt free batteries is slowing the pace of long term growth compared with other battery metals such as lithium and nickel.", "1202": "In recent years, LFP cathode chemistries have rapidly expanded their market share in the EV industry, reaching a 40% share in 2023.", "1203": "Alternatives to lithium ion batteries, particularly sodium ion batteries, are also gaining traction in the EV market.", "1204": "It will take time for this relatively new technology to reach a full commercialisation, but the rise of alternatives implies a smaller piece of the EV battery pie left for cobalt.", "1205": "Even among the traditionally popular NMC chemistries, the market is increasingly favouring chemistries with lower cobalt intensity.", "1206": "However, while alternative batteries with low or no cobalt are gaining traction, the overall size of the EV market continues to expand, supporting continued demand growth in the medium to long term.", "1207": "Cobalt\u2019s role decreases steadily for battery storage, reaching negligible levels by 2050 in both the APS and NZE Scenario.", "1208": "Compared with EVs, storage batteries are not limited by space constraints, so the market is heading towards cheaper alternatives with lower energy density such as LFP cathode chemistries or sodium ion batteries, neither of which contains cobalt.", "1209": "Outside of batteries, cobalt was used the most in superalloys integral to the military and aerospace industries due to its pivotal role in providing strong resistance to corrosion, extreme temperature and high pressure.", "1210": "Demand for cobalt in superalloys continues to remain robust.", "1211": "The industries consuming these superalloys are typically less price sensitive, thus ensuring relatively stable demand, as evidenced by recent price trends where cobalt metal alloys consistently maintained higher prices than cobalt sulphate during periods of price downturns.", "1212": "The cobalt market is well supplied today.",

Ganzhou, Jiangxi province, suffered production capacity reductions of at least 25% after border gates between Myanmar and China were shut down at the beginning of the year, illustrating the significance of the current suspension.", "1442": "While reserves should be sufficient for up to three to six months, any extended suspension of REE mining in Kachin state could be damaging for refineries in China reliant upon feedstock from Myanmar.", "1443": "The government guided price for REEs in China has remained relatively low to incentivise downstream production, as magnet producers

additions.", "1463": "In the NZE Scenario, there is an implied supply gap of 5 kt in 2030 and 14 kt in 2040.", "1464": "The major concern for magnet REE, however, is not a huge gap between demand and supply like in the case of copper or lithium, but rather an extremely important level of geographical concentration of today\u2019s as well as future mining and refining projects that expose this market significantly to supply disruptions.", "1465": "Primary supply requirements in the medium to long term are also a function of growing interest in recycling manufacturing scrap and end of life

make significant advances.", "1495": "This is not always the fault of the technology developer, however, with difficulties in acquiring necessary feedstock at commercially viable prices, as is the case for REEtec in Norway, also causing delays and setback at processors.", "1496": "Will ionic adsorption clay deposits change the game?", "1497": "Ionic adsorption clay  is also known as regolith hosted ionic adsorption deposits , which contain rare earth elements adsorbed physically to the clay minerals surface, mainly kaolinite and halloysite.", "1498": "Weathering of igneous rock, primarily granite, that contains specific rare earth bearing minerals results in the formation of IAC.", "1499": "The best environments for this process to occur are warm, humid and slightly acidic conditions in subtropical regions.", "1500": "Important source rocks typically have a relatively high background in rare earths and rare earth bearing minerals in these rocks will include monazite, xenotime, bastnaesite, allanite, titanite and apatite.", "1501": "The hype surrounding this form of deposit comes from the hope that extracting rare earths that are loosely bonded to the surface of rocks is relatively simpler, less energy intensive and cheaper than obtaining them from the depths of hard rock formations, and could also avoid the radioactive by products that accompany the traditional mining processes for these minerals.", "1502": "Ore deposits containing physically adsorbed lanthanides are substantially lower grade than other rare earth deposit types  however, the low mining and processing costs make them economically attractive as sources of rare earths.", "1503": "Global resources of HREE are dominantly sourced from Chinese regolith hosted IADs or clay deposits in Myanmar

adsorption mechanisms remain unclear.", "1505": "Traditional REE projects based on hard rock developments are extremely capital intensive and", "1506": "can cost USD 1 billion to USD 2 billion to build, for which most junior miners cannot secure funding.", "1507": "In recent years, focus in the junior miner space has shifted from highly capital intensive hard rock REE projects to low capital intensity IAC projects which are enriched in HREE.", "1508": "Despite in situ grades being lower than most hard rock projects, the mining is easier, leading to substantially lower capital expenditure and operating costs.", "1509": "Most clay operations involve digging or scraping of only the top twenty metres or so of earth, as opposed to blasting hard rock sources which may extend down to hundreds of metres or more.", "1510": "Clay material is soft and requires only breaking up, whereas hard rock material needs to be crushed and ground, often in large quantities.", "1511": "Then there is the processing.", "1512": "Large scale high temperature roasting and acid leaching for hard rock projects, compared with heap or vat leaching at atmospheric temperature and pressure for ionic clay projects.", "1513": "Last but not least, clay waste material is generally inert and can be backfilled into the mining area, meaning there is no need for tailings dams or dry stacking.", "1514": "In regolith deposits, Chinese miners found that weakly acidic ammonium sulphate or sodium chloride solution readily reclaims the rare earths from the ionic bonded clays, allowing the resulting crude solution to be chemically treated to eliminate contaminants for further solvent extraction separation and refining.", "1515": "This processing can be in situ leaching heap leaching or in tank leaching with increasing cost and all with significant environmental impact.", "1516": "Generally, Chinese costs for REE reclamation from IAC deposits are low and despite the low recoveries peaking at around 30% to 40% in final products, these projects appear to be economic.", "1517": "The economic viability of IAC deposits remains uncertain, but they look increasingly attractive from perspectives of capital intensity, ease of working, carbon intensity and radioactive waste management.", "1518": "While China appears to have developed a low cost method of reclaiming rare earths from IAC deposits, not all REE clay projects are IAC projects and it is important for prospective investors to have sufficient metallurgical testing carried out to establish the ionic adsorption capacity and suitability for ion exchange within all new clay discoveries.", "1519": "There has been a steady flow of announcements of IAC discoveries outside southern China and Myanmar in recent years, such as in Australia, Brazil and Uganda.", "1520": "How quickly these discoveries can be converted to projects operating at scale remains to be seen.", "1521": "In March 2024, Appia Rare Earths & Uranium announced a maiden mineral resource estimate for its ionic adsorption clay PCH project in Goi\u00e1s, Brazil.", "1522": "In addition to the growth in IAC type production, the most significant change in the rare earth space would be the growth of supply from heavy mineral sand  operations, which are expected to contribute volumes of not only Nd Pr feedstocks but also provide notable quantities of Dy Tb to downstream processors.", "1523": "While some HMS producers are looking to integrate production, as is the case with Iluka, Energy Fuels and Tronox, many producers will continue to supply material into

Samsung and Stellantis.", "1527": "One apparent disadvantage of iron nitride magnets is that their coercivity is less than that of neodymium.", "1528": "Coercivity is a measure of the magnet\u2019s ability to resist having the polarity of its field reversed when exposed to a strong opposing field.", "1529": "Without coercivity, the magnetic fields in a motor would rotate without turning the shaft.", "1530": "Initial assessments indicate that iron nitride will struggle to compete with incumbent neodymium iron boron magnets for automotive drivetrains as the importance of high magnetic

USD 2 100 to USD 2 450 per tonne over the past year, with the strong dollar and slowing industrial activity setting a ceiling on prices.", "1532": "This trend is likely to continue in the near term owing to the persistent slowdown in manufacturing as well as supply side uncertainty.", "1533": "In the long term, global demand growth is expected to narrow the surplus, driven in large part by increasing utilisation in clean energy applications.", "1534": "Aluminium\u2019s use as a lightweight structural element in solar PV installations and EVs is expected to remain as a primary demand

existing industrial and ICE applications.", "1619": "Palladium and rhodium demand are likely to decline structurally due to the uptake of EVs.", "1620": "In addition, growing secondary supplies are likely to exert further pressure on producers, especially for North American mines mining palladium rich ores.", "1621": "Demand for iridium and ruthenium are likely to increase consistently in the coming years thanks to demand for membrane electrodes, including those used in proton exchange membrane hydrogen electrolysers.", "1622": "This is likely in spite of continued technical research and development to reduce the amount of precious metals per unit product.", "1623": "Price volatility in the iridium market is expected to continue, driven by concerns over long term supply.", "1624":

resource quality over the past few years, have persisted even as commodity prices have dropped in recent years.", "1689": "Rising interest rates have further elevated capital costs for producers.", "1690": "As a result, margins have been reduced across the board, impacting operations at each stage of the value chain.", "1691": "During periods of weak prices, these factors led some producers across many commodities to reduce or defer spending on mines as well as midstream assets.", "1692": "Increasingly stringent environmental, social and governance  requirements have also influenced project costs in some advanced economies, making these assets less competitive compared with those in countries with lower regulatory standards.", "1693": "Although the volatile, cyclical nature of commodity prices is well understood by market participants, the policy focus on ramping up the supply of critical minerals for the energy transition has been challenged by record price volatilty and persistent supply chain disruptions.", "1694": "Investors and producers have thus been reluctant to commit to large projects without sufficient confidence in the long term business case for new and more diversified assets.", "1695": "The lack of transparent pricing for many minerals contributes to this uncertainty.", "1696": "Although price discovery for metals such as nickel and copper takes place on liquid exchanges, pricing of lithium, cobalt and graphite, among other materials, still relies upon bilateral contracts that are surveyed and reported by price reporting agencies.", "1697": "Uncertainty over capital costs exacerbates the challenges facing project developers.", "1698": "For instance, in recent years, several lithium raw material development projects experienced a more than 50% increase in estimated capital intensity between pre feasibility studies or preliminary economic assessments, and definitive feasibility studies.", "1699": "Diversified refining and processing projects face additional challenges due to their limited pricing power, especially for non integrated assets, relative to powerful incumbents.", "1700": "Positioned between the raw materials and the

Republic of China .", "1703": "Without specific government measures to reinforce the investment case, consumers and investors typically do not assign much value to diversification, so such projects often face major challenges in mobilising the necessary capital.", "1704": "Moreover, many companies that aim to develop new refining and processing projects in diversified regions are small in size with limited track records, making it challenging to mobilise debt financing at affordable rates.", "1705": "Governments can intervene in various ways to help finance more diversified value chains.", "1706": "These interventions can come from four main sources: government departments and policy banks, sovereign wealth funds , development finance institutions , and export credit/insurance agencies .", "1707": "These agencies may engage directly with private sector firms, through state owned or backed enterprises, in a hybrid fashion, or in partnership with foreign counterparts.", "1708": "They

there are often significant overlaps in the remits and capabilities of many of these institutions, they are differentiated in their strategic focus, risk tolerance, and the time horizon of their investment decision making, as outlined in the table at the end of this section.", "1710": "The support they provide can be either in the form of capital expenditure  financing, operating expense  support, and/or risk mitigation.", "1711": "The vast majority of financial support mechanisms for the critical minerals sector have focused on large upfront capital expenditures.", "1712": "These include finance for the construction of mines, refineries and processing plants, and factories.", "1713": "These transactions, like those in the private sector, can contribute to various parts of the capital stack , as loans, equity stakes, or grants.", "1714": "In the United States, the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office  has to date authorised more than USD 5 billion in conditional loan commitments for domestic minerals projects.", "1715": "Among these, the USD 2,26 billion conditional loan for Lithium Americas\u2019 Thacker Pass mine is the largest public commitment for a single project.", "1716": "The French government, through the General Secretariat for Investment , invested EUR 500 million as the anchor investor in a EUR 2 billion critical minerals fund managed by InfraVia, an infrastructure asset manager.", "1717": "In contrast to the approach taken by the US LPO and International Development Finance Corporation , which has invested directly in specific projects and companies, this investment relies on the external fund manager to identify the opportunity set and capitalise on them in alignment with French government policy.", "1718": "In addition to capex support, opex support measures are also adopted in ensuring the long term bankability of projects given the decades long investment horizons associated with planning, operating, and decommissioning.", "1719": "By lowering operating costs associated with mineral extraction and processing and helping stabilise long term cash flows, higher cost operations can improve economic competitiveness, thus helping the aim of diversification.", "1720": "One of the most prominent policy initiatives for supply chain diversification is the Inflation Reduction Act  in the United States.", "1721": "The use of various tax credits on both the supply and demand sides have led to significant investment in the downstream domestic supply chain as well as the formation of agreements with free trade agreement compliant upstream suppliers.", "1722": "In addition to investment support through capital cost tax credits , there are also production cost credits  which provide 10% production tax credit for critical mineral processors.", "1723": "These forms of opex support can be effective in improving the business case to stimulate new investment, but require more policy commitment as they incur sustained financial burden over the long term.", "1724": "Despite the attractiveness and importance of ongoing financial support mechanisms, their long term nature also makes them more sensitive to political headwinds.", "1725": "This is in contrast to direct capex financing mechanisms, where committed loans and disbursements cannot easily be clawed back after a change in administration.", "1726": "A third group of financial measures comprises options that are intended to de risk investments and crowd in other investors, rather than directly subsidising or financing projects.", "1727": "Common strategies include offering loan guarantees to reduce the financial risk for private investors by providing a sovereign backstop, insuring transactions against counterparty risks that may not be available at a reasonable rate from commercial insurers, and directly lowering the cost of debt by bridging the gap between rates available to public institutions and the firm or project seeking funding.", "1728": "These services are often offered by ECAs, which typically have expertise in risks associated with complex, multi jurisdictional projects, in addition to or as an alternative to direct financing options.", "1729": "For instance, the Korean Export and Import Bank, as part of the government\u2019s five year plan to support battery supply chains, has increased the maximum loan size from 40% of the owner\u2019s equity to 50%, in addition to a preferential rate up to 120 basis points  lower.", "1730": "Furthermore, the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation has announced an insurance policy discount of up to 20% in addition to increases in loan guarantees available.", "1731": "In 2022, Canada\u2019s Critical Minerals Strategy introduced the 30% Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit  aimed at helping companies raise equity capital by incentivising investors with tax benefits associated with flow through shares.", "1732": "This functions by allowing investors to claim a tax deduction equivalent to a portion of exploration expenditures incurred by the company.", "1733": "The CMETC acts in parallel with, but cannot be claimed in addition to, the existing Mineral Exploration Tax Credit  of 15%.", "1734": "The METC, originally set to expire in March 2024, was extended to March 2025.", "1735": "The Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada estimates that flow through share financing contributes over 65% of the funds raised on Canadian stock exchanges for exploration across the country.", "1736": "These tax credits do not subsidise upstream companies directly, but serve to encourage equity investment during the high risk exploration phase.", "1737": "Many of these policy intervention tools  are intended to support national or regional strategies to decrease the geographic concentration of critical mineral supply chains.", "1738": "This can involve developments in either domestic projects or foreign projects with strategically aligned states.", "1739": "Government departments and policy banks typically focus their spending on domestic projects and firms.", "1740": "For those without domestic reserves, DFIs and ECAs are the preferred vehicle given their specific mandate for foreign transactions.", "1741": "SWFs and policy banks with broad investment mandates are not common in advanced economies seeking to diversify their critical minerals supply chains, but there are examples elsewhere.", "1742": "For example, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which has a wide ranging mandate to actively invest over the long term to maximise sustainable returns, has taken an active position in global critical mineral supply chains as a financier of domestic and foreign projects.", "1743": "Financial support from public agencies and institutions not only directly supports investments in projects, but may also serve three important but indirect functions: intergovernmental policy signalling to mitigate potential geopolitical risks, crowding in private capital, and freeing up funds for redeployment.", "1744": "Given the financial challenges associated with supply chain diversification, there are several aspects to consider when countries introduce policy intervention tools to support financing.", "1745": "First, cross agency coordination.", "1746": "The multiple risks associated with mineral value chains , geopolitical, financial, environmental, etc. , mean that the expertise of various departments and agencies is required to ensure that investments meet domestic and international guidelines.", "1747": "Furthermore, investment mandates of agencies such as government policy banks and DFIs often overlap but without a specific mandate to focus on mineral security.", "1748": "Coordination and information sharing between agencies can contribute to strategic alignment, ensuring efficient allocation of resources.", "1749": "Second, tailored, fit for purpose investments.", "1750": "Given the numerous policy options available, investments in critical mineral supply chains should be tailored to meet specific strategic objectives, such as reducing import dependency, improving environmental sustainability, and ensuring the economic viability of domestic resources.", "1751": "A wide range of investment structures should be evaluated for their ability to address the unique risks at each stage of the supply chain.", "1752": "Finally, financial incentives should aim to be synergistic across the whole value chain, rather than focusing narrowly on one sector.", "1753": "In particular, midstream processing of mined material into intermediate products is often lacking the support seen for end use sectors.", "1754": "Every country\u2019s strategy on critical minerals will inevitably reflect its specific circumstances, but it would be a mistake for such strategies to focus only on increased exploration, mining and refining investment.", "1755": "A comprehensive approach to security and sustainability of supply needs to also address the demand side of the equation, which plays a crucial role in narrowing supply demand gaps while simultaneously mitigating the potential environmental and social harms associated with resource extraction and use.", "1756": "This encompasses elements such as innovation, recycling, behavioural measures and rigorous sustainability standards.", "1757": "The importance of unlocking the power of technology and recycling has long been a theme of IEA analysis and this was one of the key takeaways from the first ever IEA Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Summit in September 2023.", "1758": "Recycling creates a secondary supply of minerals that relieves the pressure on primary supply from mining and refining.", "1759": "A strong focus on recycling can deliver triple benefits: complementing primary mineral supplies, improving security of supply for regions with limited resource endowments and enhancing environmental performance and waste management.", "1760": "For base metals such as aluminium, recycling practices are well established, but this is not yet the case for many energy transition minerals such as lithium, nickel  and rare earth elements .", "1761": "For battery metals, today\u2019s feedstock for recycling is dominated by electronic waste and scrap from manufacturing processes,", "1762": "but this is set to change by the end of the decade as the first generation of electric vehicles reach the end of their life.", "1763": "Globally, around 30 GWh of spent electric car batteries is expected to be available for recycling by the end of the decade.", "1764": "While recycling would not eliminate the need for continued investment in new supplies, we estimate that by 2040, recycled quantities of copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt from clean energy applications could reduce primary supply requirements for key minerals by 10 30%.", "1765": "The security benefits of recycling can be far greater for regions with wider deployment of clean energy technologies due to greater economies of scale.", "1766": "A strong example of the environmental benefits comes from the aluminium industry, where recycling of post consumer scrap has been shown to reduce emissions by 90% compared with primary aluminium.", "1767": "Furthermore, recent studies show that total GHG emissions for manufacturing a nickel rich lithium ion battery cell can be around 28% lower if made from recycled materials rather than virgin minerals.", "1768": "Recovering minerals from mine waste, also known as tailings reprocessing, is a growing area of interest.", "1769": "As ore grades decline, larger amounts of wastes are generated during mining, increasing the economic and environmental cost of tailings management.", "1770": "Advancements in processing technologies mean that some tailings have grades comparable to currently economical ore deposits.", "1771": "Thus, reprocessing can have various benefits: revenue opportunities, water recovery and environmental impact mitigation.", "1772": "Technology advances also have a major role in alleviating potential supply strains.", "1773": "For example, significant reductions in the use of silver and silicon in solar cells over the past decade have contributed to a spectacular rise in deployment of solar PV.", "1774": "For grids, our projections indicate that deploying high voltage direct current transmission lines more widely in electricity networks has the potential to shrink their material demand by 3% in 2030 and 10% in 2050.", "1775": "Similarly, a sensitivity case covering an accelerated global adoption of lithium iron phosphate chemistries and sodium ion batteries could reduce mineral demand for EV batteries by around 13% in 2030 and 18% in 2050 compared to the NZE Scenario\u2019s base case.", "1776": "Energy demand depends on the behavioural choices of millions of consumers worldwide.", "1777": "Behavioural changes are actions that energy consumers take to reduce wasteful or unnecessary energy consumption.", "1778": "Many of these changes take place as part of daily life, and involve using energy differently or using less of it.", "1779": "These changes depend in part on individual choices and evolving socio cultural norms.", "1780": "However, it is systemic transformations brought about by targeted and well designed policy interventions that count most in changing consumer behaviour, and these often depend on the availability of infrastructure of one kind or another.", "1781": "Behavioural changes in the NZE Scenario help to bring about a more equitable and just energy transition.", "1782": "But in terms of critical minerals, behavioural changes can also imply a more tempered demand that can help narrow the demand supply gap, especially changes in behaviour related to transport needs.", "1783": "In 2022, electric SUVs accounted for over half of global electric car sales for the first time ever and took up 16% of total SUV sales.", "1784": "Such a consumer preference is contributing to a further increase in mineral demand as SUVs require larger batteries to power them.", "1785": "Behavioural changes and targeted measures to tame the appetite for SUVs and other large vehicles could result in considerable demand reduction for battery metals.", "1786": "IEA projections based on these specific sensitivity cases show that measures to promote smaller electric cars lead to a more than 10% reduction in battery mineral demand by 2030 projected in the NZE Scenario, compared with a counterfactual case where SUV demand continues to grow.", "1787": "In February 2024, the city of Paris took measures to moderate the average size of cars on the roads by voting for elevated parking tariffs for larger private vehicles.", "1788": "Other behavioural measures that can reduce car traffic and thereby, not just gasoline demand from internal combustion engine vehicles but also demand for battery metals for EVs, include increased share of carpooling, active modes of transportation and public transit in total road passenger transport.", "1789": "The IEA recently showed that, in the case of lithium, the combination of smaller EV battery sizes, alternative chemistries and recycling could reduce demand for lithium by 25% in 2030 in the NZE Scenario, saving an amount similar to today\u2019s production volumes.", "1790": "With these reductions, new supplies would need to grow by 20% per year between today and 2030.", "1791": "The lithium industry managed to deliver this scale of growth in recent years.", "1792": "For example, lithium raw material supply grew by roughly 20% per year over the past five years.", "1793": "Global battery recycling capacity surpassed 300 GWh in 2023, of which more than 80% was located in China, far ahead of Europe and the United States with under 2% each.", "1794": "Many technology developers and industry actors are seeking to position themselves in the future market for end of life EV management and have announced considerable capacity expansions.", "1795": "If all announced projects are developed in full and on time, global battery recycling capacity could exceed 1 500 GWh in 2030, of which 70% is in China, and about 10% each in Europe and the United States.", "1796": "The main sources of supply for battery recycling plants in 2030 will be EV battery production scrap, accounting for half of supply, and retired EV batteries, accounting for about 20%.", "1797": "From 2030, end of life batteries surpass manufacturing scrap as the primary source of recycling.", "1798": "Policy measures, including standardisation and alignment of battery waste and transportation codes , the implementation of extended producer responsibility principles for EV batteries, the development of comprehensive collection infrastructure, and the initiation of information and communication campaigns, all play pivotal roles in encouraging the uptake of battery recycling.", "1799": "Despite the undeniably significant role of batteries in total mineral demand, as the clean energy transition ramps up in almost every major region, recycling efforts will need to extend to technologies beyond batteries as well.", "1800": "In addition to scaling up recycling infrastructure, efforts also need to be directed towards the maintenance and repair of products that will enable longer use.", "1801": "The share of secondary supply in mineral demand has remained fairly stable for the last decade, but this changes rapidly in the NZE Scenario.", "1802": "The share of secondary supply for nickel needs to grow from around 1% today to 3% in 2030, and that of lithium from 3% to 5% in the same period.", "1803": "By 2040, secondary supply share of most major critical minerals would need to reach at least 15% under the NZE Scenario.", "1804": "If the share of secondary supply were to stay at today\u2019s levels, capital requirements for mining to meet demand in climate driven scenarios would have been a third higher, highlighting the significance of recycling in alleviating pressure on primary supply.", "1805": "Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing is extending product lifetimes to reduce the need for new production, such as Siemens Gamesa\u2019s lifetime extension program for wind turbines.", "1806": "Recycling is collecting, processing, and reusing materials that would otherwise be discarded as waste, with measures like minimum recycled content requirements and extended producer responsibility regulations.", "1807": "Substitution is using renewable or more sustainable materials, such as chemistry changes for electric vehicle batteries.", "1808": "Material efficiency is designing products and processes to minimize material use, waste, and environmental impact, such as reducing iridium loading in electrolyser manufacturing.", "1809": "Product as a Service is adopting business models that provide services instead of selling products, like vehicle sharing schemes to increase asset utilization.", "1810": "Behavioral changes involve encouraging individuals to adopt more sustainable habits, such as choosing smaller vehicles or reducing private car journeys by using public transportation.", "1811": "Despite strong expected increases in demand, market transparency of commodities such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements remains limited, challenging price hedging and discouraging investment and risk assessments.", "1812": "Market transparency covers both the question of pricing , including efficient market price discovery mechanisms and financial tools to hedge price risks , and information , the importance of publicly available data on consumption, supply, inventories, trade and ESG performance.", "1813": "Transparency of pricing and market information brings important benefits to all aspects of the supply chain: producers and consumers are able to hedge their price risk, plan their stocks and production, and negotiate fair contracts.", "1814": "Merchants and intermediaries are able to correct global supply and demand imbalances as efficiently as possible.", "1815": "Governments benefit by being able to plan ahead and ensure supply continuity.", "1816": "Information transparency enables the anticipation of potential risk areas, allowing policymakers to target support where it is most needed.", "1817": "The primary element of a well functioning market for minerals and metals is transparency of pricing.", "1818": "Efficient price discovery processes provide two main benefits to the market: first, they offer clearer market signals, aiding informed investment decisions second, they facilitate the development of financial tools to mitigate risks, allowing for hedging by midstream operators  and downstream consumers.", "1819": "In a developed, sophisticated market, this means that there is a clear \u201cspot\u201d price , as well as a futures price curve , that is information about prices for delivery months or years into the future.", "1820": "While some commodities such as copper and aluminium already benefit from established and regulated exchanges with ample liquidity, not all critical minerals benefit from such levels of market maturity.", "1821": "Many of their markets contend with market concentration, insufficient liquidity, and reliance on bilateral contracts.", "1822": "There are broadly four stages of development in price transparency.", "1823": "Some commodities, such as copper and nickel, are already traded on regulated exchanges, where both spot and future contracts can be publicly traded , but derivatives can also often be traded outside of these exchanges, as over the counter  forward contracts, where prices are less easily tracked .", "1824": "For others, such as lithium and cobalt, there are signs of growing trade activities at major exchanges, while remaining significantly less liquid .", "1825": "Although traded derivatives markets are important in assessing market participants\u2019 expectations, OTC financial contracts are of particular utility in risk management, as they allow more effective price hedging.", "1826": "For the less liquid markets, market players rely on unregulated spot auction platforms  or surveys from price reporting agencies   or other key market actors, who may , or may not , meet the principles set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions .", "1827": "The different stages of market maturity discussed here are indicative, and each element may face different circumstances.", "1828": "Price data are often much more limited for midstream processing than refined material.", "1829": "While for some commodities, such as copper, \u201ctreatment and refining charges\u201d  are tracked by agencies, data are less available for other commodities.", "1830": "The absence of data on refining costs and prices, as well as existing capacities and stockpiles, restricts further investments in midstream capacities, and thus their diversification.", "1831": "Some of the smaller commodities may have structurally insufficient liquidity pools for market based price discovery mechanisms.", "1832": "In these cases, policymakers could consider various ways to incentivise or encourage contributions by market participants to PRAs\u2019 platforms who adhere to the IOSCO principles or their equivalents, or to enhance data collection from businesses.", "1833": "Regulated markets also require deep liquidity pools for effective price discovery.", "1834": "In this context, governments could avoid actions that would further fragment liquidity pools.", "1835": "For cobalt and lithium in particular, there is a question as to whether physically deliverable contracts could be possible.", "1836": "This would have the advantage of providing stocks data to the market, which gives some proxy data to the market as to supply and demand.", "1837": "Finally, there is a growing interest in pricing schemes that incorporate ESG performance.", "1838": "While many PRAs are introducing new price indices, it is uncertain whether these indices would achieve sufficient liquidity without policy and regulatory support to encourage consumers to consider sustainability aspects in their procurement decisions.", "1839": "Understanding critical mineral production and refining", "1840": "also relies both on public data and on mining and supply chain actors, with multiple benefits: allowing more informed investment decisions, facilitating supply risk identification along the supply chain, enabling systematic tracking of ESG performance, informing due diligence efforts, facilitating audit and verification of claims and ensuring better accountability.", "1841": "However, information transparency faces significant challenges , insufficient publicly available data, particularly on the midstream, underlaid by a lack of consensus on what data could or should be shared through the supply chain, and further disclosed to the public and consumers.", "1842": "Some nations already disclose significant data on mining volumes, given the economic and social importance of this activity in their jurisdictions.", "1843": "Stock exchanges and their regulators, particularly in Canada  and Australia , have also played a crucial role in making more data on production and reserves of publicly traded mining companies accessible.", "1844": "Public data initiatives have the potential to offer valuable insights to stakeholders in the market.", "1845": "While some disclosures have been made under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , countries do not necessarily
