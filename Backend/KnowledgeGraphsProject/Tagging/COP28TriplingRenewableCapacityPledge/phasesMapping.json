"Enable renewable energy installations to be more cost competitive with fossil fuel fired plants.", "447": "Countries could consider introducing policies that derisk initial exploration and

availability of lowcost equipment by co ordinating trade restrictions with local manufacturing capabilities.", "457": "Ensure that the legal framework lays out renewable energy curtailment rules.", "458": "Countries could consider increasing data transparency for economic and technical curtailment by improving the regulatory framework.", "459": "setting clear and fair curtailment rules based on electricity security.", "460": "advancing towards an economic dispatch of the power system to ensure that renewables can also contribute.", "461": "In cases where economic dispatch is not implemented, support participation of VRE in the system by measures such as a minimum full load hour guarantee, with clear timelines for phasing out as VRE capacity further expands.", "462": "Having high VRE resource potential, many developing economies could use this potential and deploy renewable technologies to meet rising power demand costeffectively as access to electricity and energy services expands.", "463": "However, many of these countries usually have elevated macroeconomic risks, restricted budgets, limited experience with renewable energy, weak grid infrastructure, and vertically integrated or single buyer electricity markets.", "464": "Starting from a very small capacity base, many developing countries have introduced high ambitions to meet their growing energy needs primarily with renewable electricity technologies because the generation costs are generally lower than for fossil fuel alternatives.", "465": "Moreover, in many of these countries, the unexploited potential of renewables is huge.", "466": "This cluster includes low income developing countries with minimal renewable energy penetration in Africa, Asiaand the MENA region.", "467": "Deploy off grid and mini grid renewable energy solutions in coordination with grid expansion plans.", "468": "In many developing countries in this cluster, generation costs for PV plus battery systems are lower than for diesel generators.", "469": "Countries could therefore consider removing barriers to off grid applications and mini grid systems to improve electricity access for consumers in areas where grid extension is not cost effective.", "470": "incentivising individuals and private sector to build and operate renewable energy projects, gaining skills and experience.", "471": "Concessional financing could further spur deployment, potentially stimulating the participation of national capital in the sector .", "472": "Develop untapped hydropower potential.", "473": "Incorporating new, large scale wind and solar PV capacity into an already weak grid can be challenging, but, where available, hydropower projects can cost effectively increase electricity access and provide dispatchable electricity generation.", "474": "While large hydropower projects require simultaneous grid development to connect the plant, expanding the electricity infrastructure, small projects either onor off grid can also boost electricity access rapidly.", "475": "Countries could consider establishing necessary governance and institutional structures to ensure sustainable project development, taking into account the long term availability of water and its multiple uses for flood management, irrigation and drinking.", "476": "increasing access to concessional financing and introducing business models such as public private partnerships with a balanced risk allocation through project finance structures, to allocate risks to the appropriate stakeholders .", "477": "Introduce a longterm vision and

denominated in USD or EUR to reduce revenue risks for developers.", "484": "Support projects in the predevelopment phase.", "485": "Governments can do this by reducing project development and exploration risks for large scale hydropower or geothermal plants, or by defining suitable ready to develop areas for initial wind and solar PV expansion before competitive procurements are organised.", "486": "For competitive auctions, countries could consider conducting resource assessments and obtaining all necessary permits and/or land rights on behalf of winning bidders while ensuring grid access for the renewable energy project.", "487": "In addition to reducing bidder risks significantly, auction site predevelopment creates expertise and strengthens institutional capacities within the government.", "488": "Reduce offtaker risk while ensuring affordability for consumers.", "489": "Countries could improve the offtakers\u2019 financial health by reducing losses, improving collection rates and having a progressive pathway towards cost reflective tariffs as socio economic development increases.", "490": "Moreover, countries could consider introducing or expanding credit enhancement mechanisms.", "491": "Covering nonpayment delays is essential to strengthen a sector in which state owned enterprises with generally low creditworthiness are the main counterpart in PPAs with private investors.", "492": "Additionally, governments could introduce ceiling prices for competitive auctions to safeguard against excessive financial burden for offtakers.", "493": "At the same time, derisking and support policies need to be designed carefully to limit short, mediumand long term impacts on household budgets."}
