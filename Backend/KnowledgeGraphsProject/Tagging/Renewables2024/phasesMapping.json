"213": "This year\u2019s global outlook for renewable heat has been revised down 5% from Renewables 2023 projections, mostly to reflect more cautious projections for renewable electricity use in industry in the European Union, the United States and China, as well as slower than anticipated modernisation of biomass use in sub Saharan Africa and China.", "214": "Overall, projected renewable heat developments remain largely insufficient to displace fossil fuels rapidly enough to realise Paris Agreement ambitions.", "215": "To align with the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, global renewable heat consumption would have to progress 2,3 times more quickly than in our outlook, while widescale sufficiency oriented actions and much greater energy and material efficiency improvements would be needed to reduce global heat demand by 3% during 2024 2030.", "216": "While the Net Zero Scenario outlines steeper deployment trajectories for all sources, the largest absolute discrepancies between the outlook and Net Zero pathways are for the use of renewable electricity for industrial process heat  and for the modern use of biomass in buildings .", "217": "In 2023, global annual renewable capacity additions increased more than 60% to almost 565 GW, the fastest growth ever recorded.", "218": "Continuous policy support in more than 130 countries and declining costs, especially for solar PV, led to this key change in the global trend.", "219": "Last year, 40 countries broke annual deployment records, the highest number over the last decade.", "220": "However, China\u2019s record was truly exceptional, accounting on its own for two thirds of global annual additions.", "221": "In 2023, the country\u2019s solar PV additions grew 2,5 times and wind installations more than doubled.", "222": "Increases in renewable capacity additions in Europe , the United States , Brazil  and South Africa  hit all time highs.", "223": "The near doubling of utility scale solar PV additions in 2023 was the largest contributor to global renewable energy capacity growth.", "224": "China\u2019s utility scale PV additions more than tripled as module prices halved in 2023 and the government enacted a policy to accelerate construction of large scale solar PV plants in deserted areas.", "225": "The United States registered the second largest increase, nearly doubling its utility PV installations from 2022 to 2023.", "226": "Meanwhile, global distributed solar PV additions  grew over 60% last year, mostly owing to acceleration in China and Europe.", "227": "Following two consecutive years of decline, onshore wind installations rebounded 65% to 107 GW in 2023.", "228": "Once again, this increase came mostly from expansion in China, and to a lesser extent India, while additions were stable in Europe and declined in the United States.", "229": "For offshore wind, annual installations declined for the second year in a row following the record growth of 2021 .", "230": "The commissioning schedule of offshore projects from previous auctions created a lull in the European pipeline as well, with 2023 annual additions declining year on year, especially in the United Kingdom.", "231": "Hydropower

in this global trend, but expansion actually slowed in almost all key hydro regions, including North America, India, the ASEAN region and Latin America.", "233": "For other renewable energy technologies , annual growth remained stable at 8 GW in 2023, accounting for 1,5% of global renewable capacity additions.", "234": "The main case forecast expects renewable capacity additions to increase almost 20% in 2024.", "235": "This means another record year, but growth will fall below the 60% achieved in 2023.", "236": "Globally, solar PV additions are expected to expand by almost 20%, wind by 10%, and hydropower by over 85% in 2024.", "237": "Market developments in China are the main  reason for relatively slower global renewable capacity expansion.", "238": "China\u2019s renewable capacity additions are expected to increase by 20% in 2024 following the doubling in 2023.", "239": "However, rapid utility scale wind and solar PV growth last year in China has increased grid integration challenges.", "240": "In the first quarter of 2024, curtailment rates for variable renewable energy  generation increased, although they remained below 3% for both technologies.", "241":

Administration increased the allowed provincial curtailment threshold from 5% to 10%, enabling more solar PV capacity to be connected.", "244": "For Europe, we expect annual capacity additions to decline 7% in 2024 from 2023, mainly because of reduced solar PV incentives in Poland and lower auction volumes in Spain.", "245": "Distributed solar PV expansion is also decelerating in Spain and remains stable in Germany as lower electricity prices make it less economically attractive than in 2022, when Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine caused retail electricity prices to soar.", "246": "In the United States and India, supply chain restrictions have eased, leading to an increase in capacity additions in 2024, while in Brazil, reduced net metering incentives are impairing distributed solar PV growth.", "247": "In ASEAN countries and sub Saharan Africa, major hydropower projects are expected to become operational in 2024, boosting capacity additions significantly in both regions.",

"260": "However, the pace at which recent policy changes will be implemented over the forecast period remains uncertain.", "261": "In addition, higher projects risk and longer timelines resulting from social acceptance challenges can limit expansion.", "262": "For these reasons, international developers and investors seeking faster project development have been channelling capital from wind to solar PV projects in the past five years.", "263": "Nevertheless, annual additions are expected to rise in Africa, the Middle East, ASEAN countries, Latin America and Eurasia , in addition to Europe,

States, Japan and Korea emerge as new gigawatt level annual markets.", "267": "Overall, macroeconomic and supply chain challenges impact offshore wind more than other renewable technologies because projects are large, lead times are long and investment requirements are relatively high.", "268": "These obstacles have reduced offshore project bankability in several European markets and led to

faster growth if grid integration challenges are resolved rapidly and companies install rooftop solar PV systems more quickly.", "306": "In advanced economies, the upside potential of the accelerated case over the main case is 184 GW for the European Union and 80 GW for the United States.", "307": "The upside in the EU also considers faster deployment of renewables for hydrogen production.",

grid infrastructure investments that delay new wind and solar PV plant connections insufficient system flexibility to cost effectively integrate variable renewable energy.", "309": "In the United States, tax credits remain a generous and stable policy incentive, stimulating power purchase agreements between developers and utilities.", "310": "For the European Union, however, government driven

manufacturing capacity is strongly outpacing both local and global demand, pushing module prices down significantly and improving solar PV competitiveness with regulated power prices.", "332": "Having a robust domestic PV market is key to absorb some of this overcapacity, as trade measures are limiting growth in export markets.", "333": "With the phaseout of central government subsidies, wind and solar PV developers are being offered 15 to 20 year power purchase contracts at administratively set provincial benchmark electricity prices, defined mostly by existing coal fired generation.", "334": "Since discontinuation of the feed in tariff policy in 2020, China\u2019s solar PV capacity additions nearly tripled to 261 GW in 2023.", "335": "Today, generation costs for new utility scale solar PV and onshore wind installations are lower than for coal fired facilities in almost all provinces, making the outlook for renewable energy more optimistic.", "336": "Our forecast therefore expects total variable renewable capacity to reach almost 4 225 GW in 2030 even though growth in annual solar PV additions slows.", "337": "China\u2019s renewable energy forecast has thus been revised up 24% from our 2023 report to account for several policy and market trends.", "338": "First, solar PV module costs have plummeted because of an expanding supply glut, while the country\u2019s interest rates have been declining since January 2023.", "339": "These rapid cost reductions have made solar PV generation more competitive with coal based electricity.", "340": "Second, recent power market reforms and green certificate systems have allowed some utility scale solar PV and wind energy developers to tap into more attractive prices than those offered by regulated contracts.", "341": "Electricity prices are higher in several provinces where more power is traded in local wholesale markets, and the energy regulator has clarified rules for green energy certificates, for which demand is increasing rapidly.", "342": "Furthermore, developers in resource rich areas can gain additional revenues by selling green power to other provinces.", "343": "Third, the central government\u2019s Whole County PV pilot policy requiring a percentage of rooftops to be equipped with PV panels, combined with provincial financial support for small scale residential solar PV and rising retail electricity prices in industry in 2023, has been a key driver for faster commercial and industrial deployment.", "344": "However, China\u2019s rapid growth in solar PV and onshore wind installations is expected to increase grid integration challenges for new utility scale and distributed PV projects, impacting project economics in the medium term.", "345": "In Northern and Northeastern provinces, curtailment of utility scale solar PV and wind has been rising and is expected to negatively impact the bankability of new projects, especially because greater capacity is being deployed in these grid areas.", "346": "In addition to transmission grid constraints in resource rich provinces, distribution grid challenges are on the rise because the country has installed 180 GW of commercial and residential PV capacity since 2021.", "347": "In our accelerated case, speeding up power market reforms and green energy certificate trading among provinces can alleviate system integration issues and unlock an additional 11% of capacity.", "348": "Nevertheless, the accelerated case\u2019s upside potential over the main case remains limited, as China\u2019s current growth trajectory already indicates it will overachieve on most of its announced renewables related targets.", "349": "The United States is forecast to add nearly 500 GW of renewable energy capacity over 2024 2030, almost all in solar PV and

most.", "351": "We have revised onshore and offshore wind combined down by over 20% due a slow to refresh project pipeline and supply chain issues siting and permitting challenges  and project uncertainty due to economic conditions .", "352": "All technologies are facing longer wait times for connection due to lengthening queues, though federal and regional reforms are being implemented to reduce connection queue length and wait times.", "353": "Solar PV leads additions, with utility scale capacity increasing steadily throughout the forecast period, though a contraction in residential growth is expected this year as the new net metering rules in California, the country\u2019s largest residential market, impact growth, and high interest rates impact project economics.", "354": "Meanwhile, the federal investment tax credit, along with state and utility level incentives for net metering, drives distributed solar PV growth.", "355": "For onshore wind, the project pipeline has been slow to refresh, and while annual additions will increase throughout the forecast period, growth is much stronger in the second half owing to the higher project volumes expected.", "356":

"357": "Additional projects that have already received federal approval boost additions in the second half of the forecast period.", "358": "However, project economics continue to cause postponements and cancellations, resulting in a 15% downwards revision of the offshore wind forecast.", "359": "While the IRA has provided long term production or tax incentives for growth, market difficulties persist.", "360": "First, supply chain constraints have led to project delays for both wind and solar PV.", "361": "While challenges related to logistics and pricing have eased, the compounding effects of previous delays are still evident, especially in the short term.", "362": "Second, grid constraints and connection queue backlogs are becoming an increasing concern.", "363": "Finally, siting restrictions are beginning to impact the development of both solar PV and wind projects, with some counties implementing stricter land use guidelines for installations, potentially impacting the areas available for development.", "364": "Additional challenges for solar PV include the end of the moratorium on antidumping and countervailing duties  on solar modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia and Viet Nam, and an increase in tariffs for solar cells manufactured in China.", "365": "Higher tariffs could impact project economics, potentially slowing development.", "366": "For offshore wind, economics continue to impact projects, with additional capacity being delayed in 2024.", "367": "However, projects that were previously cancelled have been re bid in state level tenders, raising the long term forecast, but long approval and construction timelines mean that much of this capacity will not be installed until after 2030.", "368": "New state tenders help attract additional capacity to the growing US market but, again, lengthy project development time frames mean these installations have only a marginal impact on our forecast.", "369": "In the accelerated case, mitigating these obstacles results in over 16% higher growth than in the main case.", "370": "Renewable energy capacity in Asia Pacific  is expected to expand more than 680 GW in 2024 2030,

responsible for over half of expected growth, followed by the ASEAN region .", "373": "Over 70% of overall additions will be in solar PV, with utility scale projects providing two thirds of this growth.", "374": "However, India\u2019s large scale PV deployment dominates this trend.", "375": "Excluding India, PV growth is split evenly between distributed and large scale applications in the rest of region.", "376": "Overall, the regional forecast has been revised up 15% from last year because positive developments in India and Korea offset slower expected ASEAN growth.", "377": "India is

the procurement of almost 5 GW of utility scale PV and wind capacity.", "411": "Announced plans to organise further auctions led us to revise the forecast upwards for these technologies, but reaching the government targets will require more policy support, greater immediate grid investments and streamlined permitting.", "412": "In the accelerated case, renewable capacity growth in Asia Pacific is over 30% higher than in the main case given the region\u2019s untapped potential, significantly exceeding global average upside potential.", "413": "However, achieving this would require the removal of hindrances to distributed PV and onshore wind development in India immediate investments in system flexibility and grids in Japan, Australia and Viet Nam the swift introduction or expansion of long term policy support in ASEAN countries and Korea and streamlined project permitting throughout the entire region.", "414": "The share of renewables in total power generation in Asia Pacific is expected to increase from 22% in 2023 to 32% in 2030, in line with the global trend.", "415": "As a result, the region retains its position as the third smallest renewable energy market, surpassing only Eurasia and the Middle East and North Africa.", "416": "At the same time, Asia Pacific is expected to double its VRE penetration to 19% by 2030, although this growth falls below the global average increase.", "417": "These metrics indicate that, even though renewable energy deployment is accelerating in the region, Asia Pacific still has significant untapped potential that could be used to cover growing energy demand.", "418": "Progress among the region\u2019s countries varies significantly, with Australia, Viet Nam, India and Japan being the leaders in total and variable renewable shares in power generation.", "419": "Australia quadrupled its VRE share in 2016 2023 and is expected to further double it by 2030, making it one of the global pioneers in managing high VRE energy systems.", "420": "At the same time, the significant grid congestion challenges Viet Nam experienced following its PV installation boom in 2019 2020 are expected to limit further development of this technology throughout the forecast period.", "421": "However, the country\u2019s total renewable energy share is expected to grow marginally by 2030 owing to a dynamic power demand increase.", "422": "India is deploying renewable energy at an ever increasing pace, outpacing even its rapidly rising power demand, allowing it to double its VRE share to over 30% by 2030.", "423": "Japan is expected to achieve similar results, albeit at a slower pace of expansion as power demand growth remains sluggish.", "424": "While most Asia Pacific countries still have plenty of room in their power systems to accommodate more renewables, achieving this goal will require significant effort and investment to improve power system flexibility and grid capacity to accommodate growing VRE shares.", "425": "Switching the investment focus from solar PV to other renewable technologies and energy storage could be considered.", "426": "The other group of countries in this region is progressing at a much slower pace of renewable energy penetration, especially for wind and solar PV.", "427": "By 2030, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea, Mongolia, Cambodia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are expected to obtain VRE shares of only about 10%, while Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Nepal and Myanmar are not expected to exceed 5%.", "428": "At the same time, almost all these countries are net importers of fuels used for power generation, with related costs and potential energy security challenges.", "429": "Accelerating the deployment of low cost renewable technologies, especially solar PV and wind, could therefore provide significant economic and environmental benefits, and could have a minimal impact on power system operations because baseline VRE penetration is low.", "430": "In our accelerated case, faster growth in nascent Asia Pacific VRE markets could be achieved by prioritising actions in three areas.", "431": "First, attractive long term policy support is required to limit investment risks and spur project development.", "432": "Second, providing financing at attractive rates and limiting investment costs by ensuring the availability of equipment at attractive global prices can maximise the competitiveness of renewable energy generation.", "433": "Finally, countries with overcapacity in fossil fuel fired generation  should reconsider their investment plans, set decarbonisation pathways and increase the flexibility of power purchase agreements to allow utility companies to procure more renewable energy.", "434": "In ASEAN countries, implementing these actions could lead to close to 70% higher renewable energy growth in the forecast period, with similar results expected for other low VRE countries in the region.", "435": "Europe\u2019s cumulative renewable capacity is forecast to increase 700 GW , from 894 GW in 2023 to almost 1 600 GW by 2030.", "436": "The majority  of the expansion is concentrated in just seven countries, led by Germany, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, T\u00fcrkiye, France, Spain and the Netherlands.", "437": "Solar PV makes up the largest share by far, at almost 70% of the region\u2019s capacity growth during 2024 2030.", "438": "Over the forecast period, 478 GW of solar PV is forecast to come online, more than three times onshore wind and eight times more than offshore.", "439": "Distributed solar PV leads European growth and is set to become the technology with the most installed renewable capacity by 2026 surpassing hydropower and onshore wind.", "440": "Several policy drivers underpin this expansion, most notably generous financial incentives such as net metering, remuneration for excess electricity in self consumption systems, feed in tariffs and tax rebates.", "441": "While some of these policies were already in place prior to 2022, governments increased and extended incentives  after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to dampen the impact of higher electricity prices on consumers.", "442": "These actions, combined with a relatively high retail price environment in most markets, led to the installation of a record 41 GW of capacity in 2023, 15% more than we had anticipated.", "443": "For utility scale systems, competitive auctions are the main growth driver, covering 76% of expansion.", "444": "However, our forecast depends substantially on future auction design and the impact on subscription rates, which is a key uncertainty.", "445": "In some countries, a number of developers found that the business case resulting from certain auction designs was unattractive in a high inflation environment.", "446": "For example, ceiling prices were sometimes too low or contracts offered were not indexed to inflation.", "447": "As a result, developers refrained from bidding and found other routes to develop projects, which led to auction undersubscription.", "448": "Thus, certain countries  have taken steps to improve the design of their auctions and have experienced increased participation, especially for utility scale solar PV.", "449": "However, others such as Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom are still in the revamping process and it remains to be seen whether the new designs will result in higher subscription rates.", "450": "The forecast for auctioned capacity also depends on how member states modify their auction designs to implement the required non price prequalification from the Net Zero Industry Act and if it has an impact on subscription rates .", "451": "After competitive auctions, the second largest stimulant of utility scale growth is corporate PPAs, which account for almost one fifth of the expansion, mostly in Spain, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark.", "452": "PPAs are attractive mainly because they offer long term visibility over power prices for large industrial consumers looking to hedge against high or fluctuating retail rates or utilities seeking protection from volatile wholesale prices.", "453": "Also facilitating corporate PPA uptake is the April 2024 Electricity Market Reform, which includes a number of measures to facilitate access for smaller consumers.", "454": "Additional demand for corporate PPAs is expected from existing renewable projects for which support is expiring, but the ability of these projects to drive new capacity additions will depend on whether projects are repowered with higher capacity.", "455": "Growth from green certificates is concentrated in Belgium, while merchant revenues have an influence mostly in Spain, though price cannibalisation is increasingly posing a risk to growth.", "456": "Overall, the forecast for total renewable capacity in Europe is in line with last year however there are differences at the country and technology levels.", "457": "For distributed solar PV, higher than expected expansion in 2023 and the first half of 2024 is the reason for stronger growth prospects in Italy and Sweden.", "458": "The forecast is also higher for the Netherlands because the anticipated end to full net metering has been pushed back from 2024 to 2027.", "459": "In France, the removal of electricity subsidies temporarily introduced during the energy crisis to protect consumers from high bills is expected to sustain demand.", "460": "However, the distributed PV forecast is less optimistic for Poland and Spain, where growth slowed unexpectedly in 2023 as consumer appetite weakened due to inflation, economic uncertainty and less urgent energy security concerns.", "461": "We also expect less residential solar PV growth in Germany due to increasing concerns over system flexibility at the distribution network level.", "462": "The forecast for onshore wind is more optimistic owing to higher auction subscription rates in Germany thanks to permitting reforms, and in France because of improvements to make auctions more attractive.", "463": "A new 2030 onshore wind target in the United Kingdom also underpins higher growth for Europe.", "464": "However, this year\u2019s forecast for offshore wind growth in Europe is more pessimistic than last year\u2019s due to persistent delays in the pipeline.", "465": "Almost 80% of Europe\u2019s capacity expansion happens in the European Union, where climate and energy security ambitions for 2030 have resulted in a raft of policy frameworks to accelerate renewable capacity deployment.", "466": "Total renewable capacity in the main case reaches 1 105 GW by 2030, falling 11% short of the REPowerEU ambition of 1 236 GW due to persistent challenges to faster wind deployment.", "467": "In May 2022, the European Commission set goals to reach 1 236 GW of total renewable capacity by 2030, with 592 GW of solar and 510 GW of wind.", "468": "These goals were established to reduce reliance on imported gas following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.", "469": "They are in line with the sum of individual member state ambitions , as laid out in their draft updated National Energy and Climate Plans  , the main policy tool being used to achieve a 55% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.", "470": "In parallel, countries had already begun to implement policy changes to support faster renewable capacity expansion.", "471": "While these policies put solar PV on track to realise the bloc\u2019s 2030 ambition, more effort is needed to achieve the goals for both onshore and offshore wind.", "472": "Total installed capacity for wind reaches almost 370 GW in the main case, falling 28% short of the 510 GW target largely because permitting challenges and grid congestion have been impeding deployment.", "473": "Obtaining permits for both onshore and offshore projects has been a long and not always successful endeavour in many countries due to the complexity of the process limitations on area available for development administrative staff shortages and social opposition.", "474": "This has prevented developers from participating in auctions, led to project cancellations, and delayed construction and commissioning.", "475": "Meanwhile, long grid queues resulting from complicated application processes and inadequate network capacity are lengthening project lead times in many countries and driving up costs for developers as they await licensing.", "476": "Auction schemes with relatively low price ceilings, uncapped negative bidding, high interest rates and a lack of inflation indexation have also reduced the amount of wind capacity awarded.", "477": "To address these issues, the European Commission has released several targeted guidelines such as a grid action plan, a wind energy action plan, a communication on delivering on the offshore wind strategy, and provisions for streamlining permitting in the revised Renewable Energy Directive.", "478": "At the same time, member states have been diligently implementing reforms to accelerate permit granting, improve grid buildout and modify auction designs.", "479": "They also signed the Wind Energy Charter in December 2023, indicating their commitment to grant permits and design auctions at a faster pace.", "480": "Thanks to these actions, wind energy deployment has improved, with the number of permits hitting an all time high in several EU countries in 2023.", "481": "The most notable case is Germany, where permit grants increased 70% from 2022 to 2023 after the country implemented measures including changes to conservation acts and minimum distances, and imposed state mandates.", "482": "As a result, the April 2024 auction awarded a record 2,4 GW of onshore wind , the largest amount since the government initiated auctions in 2017.", "483": "In France, improved auction design has boosted awarded capacity.", "484": "Nevertheless, the main case forecast falls short of the 2030 targets by 22% for onshore wind and by 46% for offshore despite these efforts.", "485": "Onshore reaches 310 GW, failing to fulfil the estimated EU ambition of 400 GW because of persistent undersubscription and inadequate grid connection.", "486": "While auction undersubscription remains an issue in Italy and the Netherlands, auctions are still paused in Spain for redesign purposes, and in Germany awarded capacity is still below targeted volumes.", "487": "Meanwhile, the number of projects refused grid connection in Poland increased in 2023.", "488": "Offshore wind is forecast to reach 60 GW by 2030, just over half of the 111 GW target member states recently agreed to in the revised Ten E Regulation.", "489": "In our main case, long project lead times, infrastructure delays and supply chain constraints mean that expansion increases just 6 GW/yr , half the 13 GW/yr needed to fulfil ambitions.", "490": "In our accelerated case, total renewable capacity reaches 1 265 GW by 2030, slightly surpassing the REPowerEU ambition because solar PV exceeds the goal while wind capacity still falls short.", "491": "Despite recent policy improvements, faster wind uptake would require governments to further reduce permitting wait times, increase system flexibility , mobilise new investments for grid infrastructure and continue expanding electrification.", "492": "At the country level, not all are forecast to realise their individual national NECP ambitions, which are set to be finalised this year.", "493": "The current updated NECP drafts are ten year plans that member states are required to submit to outline their contributions for achieving 42,5% renewable energy in final energy consumption, which, together with energy efficiency targets, corresponds to a net GHG emissions reduction of 55% from the 1990 level by 2030.", "494": "However, for only 10 countries are their current draft ambitions forecast to be within reach in the main case.", "495": "The remaining 17 fall short due to permitting challenges, grid congestion, economically unattractive auction design and policy uncertainty.", "496": "In the accelerated case, however, another seven countries could attain their ambitions if these obstacles are addressed, particularly if system flexibility is improved to incorporate higher shares of solar and wind electricity.", "497": "This would require faster uptake of storage technologies, expanded interconnection infrastructure, demand side response systems and increased electrification.", "498": "However, ten countries still fall short of their aims even under accelerated case conditions.", "499": "For these countries, new policies and support schemes would be required to drastically improve market prospects.", "500": "Latin America will add over 190 GW of renewable capacity, led by solar PV  wind power  and hydropower .", "501": "Four countries make up over 85% of regional additions, with the majority in Brazil , followed by Chile , Mexico , Colombia  and Argentina .", "502": "In Brazil, continued interest in distributed solar PV and bilateral agreements for utility scale solar PV and wind power spur additions.", "503": "A mix of auctions, merchant plants and rising PPAs are the impetus in Chile, while projects developed by the state owned utility and based on wholesale market revenues lead to greater additions in Mexico.", "504": "In Argentina, PPAs are the primary growth catalyst.", "505": "However, regional annual additions decline after 2027 as distributed solar PV volumes in Brazil shrink because of decreasing incentives.", "506": "We have revised the solar PV and wind forecasts up from last year to reflect faster than expected corporate purchasing in Brazil and Argentina, the high volumes of solar PV project pipeline in Chile, distributed solar PV applications in Mexico and auctions in Colombia.", "507": "Higher solar PV shares indicate a development shift in the region, as expansion has historically centred around hydropower.", "508": "Hydropower therefore currently makes up the greatest portion of cumulative renewable energy capacity in the region, but solar PV will match it as the largest source by 2030.", "509": "Regionally, the forecast remains unchanged for hydropower, but it continues to have an important role in many countries in the region.", "510": "Some markets still have untapped hydropower potential, such as Colombia, which has the highest hydropower additions in the Latin America and Caribbean region, mainly thanks to the completion of the 2,8 GW Ituango hydropower project.", "511": "However, large scale hydropower development continues to be challenging.", "512": "For instance, Argentina\u2019s hydropower forecast has been revised 30% downwards because of project delays resulting from financing and permitting obstacles.", "513": "Slow grid expansion remains a key challenge in Latin America.", "514": "In Brazil, the increasing attractiveness of variable renewables has led to long project connection queues, increasing development lead times.", "515": "The tendering of new transmission lines aims to alleviate these infrastructure challenges.", "516": "In Colombia, delays in transmission buildout have extended project timelines, as new transmission lines are required to connect multiple renewable energy projects.", "517": "Finally, in Chile, renewable generation curtailment continues to rise due to a lack of grid infrastructure and supply demand imbalances.", "518": "However, developers are trying to mitigate this issue by pairing systems with battery storage, while standalone storage systems are attracting increasing investment.", "519": "Additional challenges in the region include permitting and social acceptance obstacles.", "520": "Hydropower has long been the dominant renewable energy technology in Latin America, providing over 40% of total regional generation in 2023 owing to the region\u2019s high resource potential.", "521": "Successful hydropower development in countries such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay pushed hydropower capacity above 200 GW in 2020.", "522": "However, the pace of new capacity additions has slowed due to rising costs and mounting social acceptance challenges, and renewable energy growth has begun to focus on solar PV and wind power.", "523": "Wind and solar PV capacity growth has increased for different reasons within the region.", "524": "For wind, competitive auctions in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina have historically driven expansion.", "525": "However, auction volumes have declined, or policy changes have discontinued government led procurement in these markets.", "526": "Instead, new catalysts for wind power expansion include bilateral agreements, especially in Brazil, where industrial customers are contracting with wind developers for large amounts of renewable capacity to meet corporate decarbonisation goals.", "527": "Utility scale and distributed solar PV have different drivers.", "528": "Utility scale solar PV accounts for nearly half of all additions in the region.", "529": "Auctions are a major driver in markets such as Colombia, while in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, projects operating in wholesale markets or under bilateral PPAs are enabling increasing amounts of capacity.", "530": "Rapid solar PV expansion in the forecast period reflects the technology\u2019s relatively low cost and short construction timelines, which allow development can happen much more quickly than for either hydropower or wind installations.", "531": "Incentive programmes support distributed solar PV, especially in Brazil and Mexico, the technology\u2019s two largest markets in the region.", "532": "In Brazil, generous net metering benefits have led to a capacity boom, with additions expected to remain high throughout the forecast period even though incentives are declining.", "533": "In Mexico, commercial and residential customers are installing PV capacity to power operations and offset electricity bills.", "534": "Distributed installations face fewer administrative requirements than utility scale projects and make up over one quarter of total installations.", "535": "Almost 90 GW of new renewable capacity is forecast for sub Saharan Africa from 2024 to 2030, increasing the region\u2019s current installed capacity by over 2,5 times.", "536": "Expansion happens mainly in South Africa, which is responsible for installing nearly 40% of the region\u2019s new capacity.", "537": "Outside of South Africa, hydropower makes up the majority of total additions in Ethiopia , Tanzania  and Angola  while solar PV leads renewable energy growth in Nigeria  and Kenya .", "538": "Solar PV and wind additions make up nearly 80% of new capacity in the region, mainly under South Africa\u2019s auction programme for utility scale renewables, coupled with distributed solar PV installations.", "539": "However, additional markets are beginning to play a larger role in solar PV and wind expansion.", "540": "In Nigeria, the phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and continuous blackouts are catalysing 7,5 GW of new distributed solar PV.", "541": "In Kenya, projects carried over from the country\u2019s old FIT programme, coupled with distributed installations, account for over 1,3 GW of new capacity.", "542": "These two markets combined are responsible for over 25% of solar PV additions in the region.", "543": "Most wind power additions are driven by South Africa\u2019s auction scheme, though awarded wind volumes have declined due to a lack of grid availability.", "544": "Outside of South Africa, policy uncertainty and the lack of a long term plan for wind development mean that developments based on several key projects are often backed by national utilities, aid agencies or development banks.", "545": "For example, Ethiopia\u2019s 100 MW of short term additions are part of a project developed by Ethiopian Electric Power with financial backing from Denmark.", "546": "While solar PV and wind make up most additions, hydropower remains key for development in many markets.", "547": "For example, it represents 82% of new capacity in Angola and 72% in Tanzania.", "548": "In addition, large scale hydropower development continues to be prominent regionally.", "549": "Four projects, Ethiopia\u2019s Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam  and Koysha Dam , Tanzania\u2019s Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station  and Angola\u2019s Caculo Cabaca Hydropower Station  add considerable capacity to national grids and make up nearly 70% of total hydropower additions in sub Saharan Africa.", "550": "While the majority of hydropower additions are through large scale projects, small hydropower development remains an important driver for electrification.", "551": "Outside of government or utility driven development, corporate entities are beginning to take an interest in sourcing their own renewable power, either within a government sponsored programme or a market structure that allows bilateral agreements or self supply.", "552": "For example, two wind farms in Kenya are being developed by an industrial conglomerate to power operations, but will be built within the existing policy framework.", "553": "In Nigeria, industries and businesses are expanding solar PV capacity for self use to replace relatively expensive diesel generation following the phase out of the subsidy and to overcome grid reliability challenges.", "554": "In South Africa, the government has lowered the minimum capacity threshold for embedded generation, leading myriad companies to install new renewable capacity.", "555": "Finally, off grid solar PV helps expand electrification, especially for areas not served by the grid, with nearly 1,5 GW of new capacity expected by 2030.", "556": "According to national plans and Nationally Determined Contributions, many countries have the ambition of adding off grid solar capacity.", "557": "Federal rural electrification agencies are emphasising solar PV for electrification, while sub Saharan Africa remains a major market for solar kits .", "558": "In Nigeria, the country with the highest number of people without access to electricity, the Rural Electrification Agency has partnered with private developers and multilateral development banks to deploy mini grids across the country.", "559": "Regional challenges include stop and go policies, high offtaker risks and low grid availability and reliability.", "560": "Policy implementation delays are stalling renewable energy development, while outstanding payments to independent power producers can weaken investor confidence.", "561": "Low system availability and reliability can lead to long connection wait times, impacting project timelines.", "562": "Additions in our accelerated case are over 30% higher, mostly from solar PV and wind.", "563": "Clear policies and regulations implemented in a timely manner, combined with additional investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure and innovative financing mechanisms facilitate higher capacity growth in the accelerated case.", "564": "In addition, the liberalisation of energy markets in many countries could attract more new capacity.", "565": "Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa have either passed legislation to liberalise their energy markets or it is pending, enabling bilateral agreements between corporations and independent power producers.", "566": "According to the combined national ambitions of sub Saharan African countries, renewable capacity would more than triple to over 165 GW by 2030.", "567": "While main case additions fall short of this, the accelerated case exceeds it by considering the region\u2019s untapped potential.", "568": "In the main case, total solar PV capacity  is expected to far exceed current country ambitions , while for wind the forecast is nearly on par .", "569": "However, hydropower falls short of the total regional ambition  in both the main case  and the accelerated case .", "570": "Large scale hydropower projects can take years to develop, and project delays can severely impact project commissioning timelines.", "571": "Outside of solar PV, wind and hydropower, forecast geothermal additions  are closely aligned with ambitions .", "572": "At the national level, 15 countries are expected to meet or exceed their ambitions for 2030, while 22 will meet or exceed them only in the accelerated case.", "573": "South Africa is forecast to surpass the almost 30 GW of total renewable capacity outlined in its latest Integrated Resource Plan .", "574": "Some countries could achieve their ambitions with single hydropower projects.", "575": "For example, with the 2023 commissioning of the Luachimo Hydroelectric Power Station, Angola exceeded its 2030 ambition and will further surpass it with the expected commissioning of the Caculo Cabaca plant during the forecast period.", "576": "Eighteen countries in sub Saharan Africa have less than 1

expanding 1,4 GW between 2017 and 2023, less than 300 MW is expected by 2030 due to the lack of a pipeline of projects in late stage development.", "588": "A 600 MW project was completed in the United Arab Emirates in 2023, and no further CSP projects are under construction in the region.", "589": "The main reason for limited CSP growth is uncertainty over whether government plans for the technology will be implemented.", "590": "Since 2016, Morocco has opened two tenders for hybrid CSP/PV projects totalling 1 030 MW, but no construction has been initiated.", "591": "The first round awarded 380 MW to CSP in 2019, but the project has not advanced because developers were asked to switch to PV or use batteries instead of thermal storage.", "592": "Recent outages of the country\u2019s first CSP plant  due to a leak in the molten salt thermal storage facility have raised concerns over the technology\u2019s viability.", "593": "Meanwhile, the government has gone ahead

Kuwait\u2019s plans to launch a CSP tender finally materialised in 2024, our main case does not assume it will reach financial close and be commissioned before 2030, given Kuwait\u2019s prolonged planning process.", "595": "Saudi Arabia dominates the region\u2019s growth, accounting for over 40% of renewable capacity expansion between 2024 and 2030.", "596": "The United Arab Emirates, Israel,

addition to climate goals, there are two main drivers of renewable energy growth in the region.", "599": "The first is fast rising domestic demand for electricity, spurred by population and economic growth.", "600": "Peak demand reached record levels this year in Kuwait, Egypt, Algeria, Oman and Iraq as soaring temperatures raised air conditioning use.", "601": "This boosted load shedding in Egypt and caused the first instance of load shedding in Kuwait.", "602": "Electricity consumption in Saudi Arabia also reached an all time high in 2023 amid population and economic growth.", "603":

hydrogen for local industries as well as ammonia for export.", "615": "In total, all MENA countries combined ambition is to reach 201 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.", "616": "While the main case forecast falls 26% short of this ambition, not all countries will miss their announced ambitions.", "617": "Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Algeria are responsible for nearly 60% of the region\u2019s total ambition, and although the outlook is more optimistic than last year in these markets, our forecast indicates that installed capacity still falls short of their 2030 ambitions.", "618": "However, we expect the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Morocco to exceed their ambitions for 2030, and Israel is within reach.", "619": "Meanwhile, Iraq and Jordan have the potential to raise their targets, as their 2030 capacity ambitions only reflect current installations.", "620": "Growth in the region could be 60%  higher than in the main case , nearing realisation of the 2030 ambition , if countries meet three key challenges.", "621": "The first is faster auction implementation.", "622": "Opening tenders, selecting winners and signing PPAs often takes more than one year, so hastening the process would get more projects online sooner.", "623": "The second challenge is to improve the regulatory and policy environment for distributed solar PV by implementing reforms to allow self consumption and introduce remuneration for excess electricity generation.", "624": "While a number of countries have established legal frameworks for self consumption and net metering, there is no public data available indicating significant deployment in the commercial and residential sectors except for the United Arab Emirates, implying that implementation remains a challenge.", "625": "In addition, ensuring that electricity tariffs are cost reflective through reforms would make renewable energy more economically attractive, especially for large industry.", "626": "Finally, more growth would occur with greater industrial electrification and with the removal of barriers to new market entrants to allow for more widespread use of corporate PPAs.", "627": "Solar PV systems and wind turbine costs are influenced by primary raw material and logistics costs.", "628": "Steel accounts for about 6 8% of total investment costs for PV and onshore wind installations, copper for 1 2%, freight and land transport for 1 2% for PV and about 6 8% for onshore wind, and aluminium for around 5 6% for PV.", "629": "Due to supply chain challenges and growing demand after the Covid 19 economic crisis, the prices of all these inputs increased significantly in late 2020 and 2021, peaking in mid 2022.", "630": "As a result, benchmark utility scale PV and onshore wind project costs rose roughly 20% between 2020 and 2022.", "631": "As supply chain constraints eased, input prices began to decline, except for freight, which increased again in 2024 due to shipping disturbances in the Red Sea.", "632": "Another important component of PV and wind generation costs is the cost of financing, expressed as the weighted average cost of capital .", "633": "In most of the world, WACC increased 1 2 percentage points in 2023 due to a rise in interest rates in most countries.", "634": "As a result of falling polysilicon prices and growing supply overcapacity, global spot prices for solar PV modules decreased 60% over 2022 2024.", "635": "However, this drop has not been felt equally in all markets: in the United States, because of various trade measures, prices have fallen only about 10% since 2022, and as of July 2024, US module prices remained three times as high as in most other countries.", "636": "Module costs made up 20 40% of utility scale solar PV system CAPEX in 2022.", "637": "Lower global module prices, as well as lower prices for raw materials such as aluminium and steel, are expected to lead to about a 20% decrease in total investment costs in 2024 compared with 2022.", "638": "However, the estimated decrease in levelised cost of electricity  is only 10%, due to a higher WACC.", "639": "In contrast to PV modules, average wind turbine prices offered by original equipment manufacturers  from Europe and the United States continued to increase in 2020 2024.", "640": "In H1 2024, the average price was over 10% higher than in 2022, despite decreases in main input costs.", "641": "This results from manufacturers raising their prices to recuperate their losses incurred during the period of supply chain disturbances.", "642": "In China however, turbine prices have been declining since 2022 due to domestic concentration of the supply chain, lower exposition to changes in steel and freight costs and increased competition between local manufacturers.", "643": "Consequently, China\u2019s average wind turbine price per MW was one third the price from European and US OEMs in H1 2024.", "644": "Turbine expenses constituted about 60% of onshore wind farm construction costs in 2022, the largest component.", "645": "Assuming European and US OEMs turbine price increases, and elevated financing costs in 2023 and 2024, the benchmark LCOE of onshore wind could be about 15% higher in 2024 than in 2022.", "646": "These costs dynamics can already be observed in renewable energy auctions conducted in recent years, with discovered solar PV tariffs decreasing sharply after 2022 and onshore wind continuing to increase in most markets.", "647": "Regardless of these changes, utility scale solar PV and onshore wind remain the cheapest sources of electricity generation in most of the world.", "648": "Possible interest rate cuts leading to lower financing costs, continued technology development and market expansion should reduce PV and wind generation costs in upcoming years.", "649": "Although renewable energy technologies are increasingly becoming more cost competitive, policies remain key for driving investment and enabling deployment.", "650": "Almost 84% of global renewable utility scale capacity growth in 2024 2030 is expected to be stimulated by policy schemes, a share similar to last year\u2019s forecast.", "651": "Policy driven deployment refers to capacity for which a government policy is the primary driver for the investment decision, for example, a policy that affects remuneration for power or reduces tax liability or introduces a purchasing obligation to meet government targets.", "652": "The two most prominent policy schemes are administratively set tariffs and premiums, which make up almost two thirds of all policy driven capacity additions, and competitive auctions, accounting for more than one fifth.", "653": "The other policy options include tax credits  and utility owned projects .", "654": "Conversely, market driven deployment is expected to account for 15% of global utility scale renewable capacity growth, slightly higher compared with last year\u2019s forecast, driven mostly by the increasing share of green certificate use in China.", "655": "Bilaterally negotiated contracts between IPPs and corporate consumers  make up more than 40% of the market driven deployment, with green certificates having a similar share.", "656": "The remaining capacity is driven by unsolicited bilateral contracts with utilities  and merchant projects .", "657": "The high global share of policy driven deployment comes largely from China, where policies are expected to support 90% of the country\u2019s growth.", "658": "For instance, China is forecast to deploy around 1 900 GW of capacity almost entirely from administratively set fixed tariffs for 15 20 years based on the provincial benchmark electricity price.", "659": "However, market based deployment, accounting for 10% of the expansion, is expected to grow, thanks to the new Green Electricity Certificate scheme introduced and updated between 2022 and 2024 which aims to facilitate inter provincial trade, track progress in meeting provincial renewable energy targets and provide a certification scheme for renewable electricity for the industry.", "660": "Excluding China, market driven deployment plays a larger role in global renewable capacity expansion, accounting for around 23%.", "661": "This share is even larger in Latin America  and in Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East .", "662": "The high share in Latin America stems from corporate PPAs in Brazil and Mexico and merchant projects and corporate PPAs in Chile.", "663": "In Africa, Eurasia and the Middle East, the growth can be attributed mostly to South Africa\u2019s corporate PPA market and unsolicited bilateral contracts in both Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.", "664": "However, in North America , Europe  and Asia Pacific , most renewable capacity growth between 2024 and 2030 will still be policy based.", "665": "Compared to last year\u2019s forecast, the shares remain relatively stable.", "666": "In North America, the majority of additions are in the United States, where tax credits for investment or electricity production are the primary catalyst.", "667": "While other policies  may also strengthen the business case, the tax credit is expected to be the main enabler for investment.", "668": "In Europe, around three quarters of utility scale growth is from competitive auctions, mostly for solar PV and wind.", "669": "The share of corporate PPAs in European renewable capacity growth remains roughly the same compared with last year\u2019s forecast, led by Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy.", "670": "Competitive auctions are also the dominant procurement method in Asia Pacific , led by India, Viet Nam, Korea and Australia, while feed in tariffs also boost expansion in Japan and Chinese Taipei.", "671": "Most market driven growth in the Asia Pacific region comes from corporate PPAs for solar PV and onshore wind projects in India and Australia, while unsolicited contracts for hydropower projects in India and for solar PV and onshore wind projects in Pakistan play also an important role.", "672": "Excluding China, competitive auctions are the single largest driver of utility scale renewable capacity additions between 2024 and 2030, accounting for almost half of the forecasted capacity growth.", "673": "However, this is largely due to their importance in solar and wind deployment, which account for 94% of the utility scale forecast.", "674": "For other technologies, different policy and market drivers are more important.", "675": "CSP has the highest share of policy driven growth in 2024 2030 due to the high upfront investments and challenging business cases.", "676": "CSP growth comes entirely from competitive auctions in Chile, Morocco, and South Africa.", "677": "Growth of solar PV and wind is largely policy driven, with shares close to 80% for each technology.", "678": "Although competitive auctions are the main catalyst of growth for variable renewables outside of China, they play a larger role in offshore wind deployment than for onshore wind and solar PV, which have slightly higher shares of market driven growth, mainly through corporate PPAs.", "679": "Conversely, only a handful of offshore wind projects commissioned by 2030 are expected to have most of their business model based on corporate PPAs or certificate revenues , more specifically projects in the Netherlands, Korea and Chinese Taipei.", "680": "However, corporate PPAs could become more important in the offshore wind market, as an increasing number of countries move to competitive auctions without remuneration.", "681": "For geothermal, three quarters of the growth can be attributed to policy driven measures, mostly through tax credits in the US and state owned utilities\u2019 investments in Kenya.", "682": "Market driven deployment is mostly triggered through unsolicited contracts in Indonesia.", "683": "For pumped storage, policies drive just over half of the deployment.", "684": "Most growth is stimulated through state owned utilities in India, while unsolicited bilateral contracts in Viet Nam, Indonesia and India contribute, as well.", "685": "More than half of the growth of conventional hydropower is expected to be market driven.", "686": "Unsolicited bilateral contracts in India, Pakistan and Indonesia contribute most to the deployment, followed by state owned utilities\u2019 investments in India, Ethiopia and Canada.", "687": "Meanwhile, administratively set feed in tariffs in T\u00fcrkiye are an important driver, as well.", "688": "Meanwhile, just over half of bioenergy deployment is driven by markets, mostly corporate PPAs in Brazil, unsolicited bilateral contracts in India and Indonesia and some merchant projects in the United Kingdom and Spain.", "689": "Policy driven deployment is expected mostly from competitive auctions in Germany, Brazil and the Netherlands and administratively set feed in tariffs in Japan and T\u00fcrkiye.", "690": "In the first half of 2024, 82 GW of renewable energy capacity was awarded globally in competitive auctions, with more than half of it concentrated in just two countries: India and Germany.", "691": "This is more than double the average volumes awarded during six month periods in recent years, and almost reaches the record level capacity awarded in tenders during the entire 2023.", "692": "In the last three years, around 40% of year end capacity was auctioned on average from January to June.", "693": "Considering this trend, global auction capacity could total slightly over 200 GW by the end of 2024, more than double of 2023.", "694": "Auction design, macroeconomic conditions, permitting pace and grid availability continue to be key factors impacting developer interest and participation.", "695": "Auction award rates have changed year on year, with the lowest in 2022.", "696": "High commodity prices, escalating investment costs and inflation, combined with relatively low ceiling prices in auctions, led the award rate to drop to 75% in 2022.", "697": "Award rates continued to increase slightly from 84% last year to 89% in the first half of 2024, with the awarding of around 82 GW of the 92 GW of auctioned capacity being offered.", "698": "In the first half of 2024, Europe and India emerged as the primary regions for renewable energy tenders, with both awarding similar volumes.", "699": "India awarded more capacity  in the first half of 2024 than in the last two years combined.", "700": "This increase in auction volumes reflects the government\u2019s implementation of a clear national auction schedule to achieve the country\u2019s renewable energy target, and modification of the design to increase subscription rates.", "701": "Meanwhile, Europe awarded a volume equal to 87% of entire capacity awarded in 2023 in the first half of 2024.", "702": "With 10,2 GW, Germany awarded almost one third of Europe\u2019s total volume.", "703": "Meanwhile, the United Kingdom awarded 9,6 GW, with offshore wind representing more than half of this capacity, followed by the Netherlands with around 7,5 GW, of which around 3,5 GW were awarded to solar PV and onshore wind and 4 GW to offshore wind.", "704": "France awarded 3,4 GW of a mix of solar PV and onshore wind.", "705": "Remaining European capacity was awarded in tenders in Norway, Italy, Austria and Croatia.", "706": "In other regions, Colombia awarded more than 4 GW to new solar PV plants in its recent auction at the beginning of the year, several US states awarded a combined offshore wind capacity of 4,6 GW, and Chinese Taipei awarded 2,7 GW of offshore wind capacity.", "707": "The technology trends in Indian and European auction results varied significantly.", "708": "Globally, in the first half of 2024 almost 60% of the utility scale solar PV capacity awarded in competitive auctions was concentrated in India, while nearly 85% of the awarded onshore wind capacity was in Europe.", "709": "In Europe, countries tender 13 14 GW of utility scale solar PV on average since 2021 each year, and the first half of 2024 was in line with this trend.", "710": "Onshore wind tenders increased, with a record 8,4 GW was awarded from January to June 2024, double the amount than in the same period last year.", "711": "Meanwhile, offshore wind auctions broke another record, with more than 13 GW awarded, of which 4 GW were in auctions for seabed leases.", "712": "The Netherlands played a significant role in this growth, awarding the leases for two offshore wind farms with a total capacity of 4 GW .", "713": "This was the first Dutch offshore wind tender since the Hollandse Kust West tender held in 2022.", "714": "In the first half of 2024, Germany successfully conducted auctions for seabed leases and potential support for two non centrally predeveloped sites with a combined capacity of 2,5 GW.", "715": "Due to the high level of competition, both auctions resulted in payments to the government, but these payments were lower than last year\u2019s auction rounds.", "716": "Offshore wind auctions continue during the second half of the year, with the leases of three centrally predeveloped sites with 5,5 GW combined.", "717": "By the time of the publication of this report in early October 2024, Germany had awarded 8 GW for this technology during the year, almost reaching last year\u2019s awarded capacity of 8,8 GW.", "718": "Meanwhile, Norway successfully conducted its first offshore wind auction, tendering a 1,5 GW wind farm that includes the seabed lease and support in the form of a contract for difference.", "719": "The United Kingdom awarded financial support to more than 5 GW of offshore wind capacity, 400 MW of which were awarded to a floating offshore wind project.", "720": "Furthermore, two fixed bottom offshore wind projects were awarded 3,3 GW, while the remaining 1,6 GW were awarded to  projects that were already successful in the 2022 auction round.", "721": "The respective seabed leases have been competitively allocated in dedicated auctions in previous years.", "722": "Nevertheless, several auctions for offshore wind in Europe have been postponed.", "723": "Portugal intended to conduct a 2 GW tender in 2024, but it is now planned for 2025.", "724": "Similarly, Norway postponed tendering of the floating offshore wind farm Utsira Nord  to 2025 to clarify and finalise the auction design and subsidy model.", "725": "Germany attained a total award rate of almost 89% in the first half of 2024.", "726": "Onshore wind auctions in the country increased the award rate to 79%, reversing a trend of decreasing rates observed in 2021 2023, thanks to several policies improving site purchase, permitting processes and reducing auction volumes.", "727": "In 2024, India achieved a total award rate of nearly 85%, and almost all solar capacity auctioned was awarded.", "728": "Although awards in auctions for hybrid solar PV and onshore wind projects started falling in 2023, volumes have increased significantly.", "729": "Onshore wind auctions reached an award rate of 44% in 2024, following the declining trend of past years.", "730": "Onshore wind is being developed mostly through hybrid projects due to challenges related to purchasing land where wind resources are rich, grid connection difficulties, and the higher average price of energy generated, which discourages DISCOMs from purchasing the power.", "731": "In contrast with 2023, many European offshore wind auctions in the first half of 2024 resulted in negative bids as they were only awarding a seabed lease or had high competition.", "732": "This means successful bidders have to sell their electricity on the market or through corporate PPAs and will not receive any support payments.", "733": "They need to submit a capacity based payment to the government, which can be interpreted as \u201cthe right to realise the project\u201d or leasing of the seabed.", "734": "While these payments can be used by governments to support the energy transition and raise public acceptance, they may impede project realisation in the future due to increased costs for the project developers.", "735": "The highest payments occurred in Germany, where a developer was awarded a 1,5 GW project with a payment of USD 1,4 million/MW, and a 1 GW site was selected with a fee of USD 1,1 million/MW.", "736": "In the last decade, average auction prices for utility scale solar PV projects have fallen continuously in all regions.", "737": "For onshore wind, however, average auction prices have been increasing since 2020.", "738": "Utility scale solar PV costs decreased in all regions and settled at an average of USD 40/MWh in the first half of 2024.", "739": "This drop was instigated largely by India, which led the world in terms of volume of solar PV capacity awarded in auctions and achieved an auction price of USD 34/MWh.", "740": "Indeed, the price of utility scale solar PV in the country dropped 23%.", "741": "In contrast, Europe\u2019s reduction was a more modest 11%, with an average price of USD 67/MWh for projects awarded in auctions in 2024.", "742": "Onshore wind technology price patterns in the first half of 2024 reveal a complex global picture with significant regional variations.", "743": "While the global average price for onshore wind decreased only slightly by 2%, this figure masks two divergent trends in Europe and India.", "744": "In Europe, where the majority of the global onshore wind capacity awarded through tenders took place, prices continued on an upward trajectory that began in 2021.", "745": "In the first half of 2024, European onshore wind prices had reached an average of USD 81/MWh, representing a 2% increase.", "746": "Meanwhile, the average price for onshore wind projects in India had increased by 12%, from USD 39/MWh to USD 43/MWh.", "747": "However, the whole Asia Pacific region shows a decrease in onshore wind prices by 36% this is explained by the comparison of high prices  and volumes in in Japan, Philippines and Thailand during 2023, with lower prices in the following year, at the range of USD 40 83/MWh.", "748": "Historically, only a handful of countries, including China and South Africa, have used non price criteria to select bids in competitive renewable energy auctions.", "749": "Outside of these markets, bid selection has been based mostly on price to minimise costs and limit government support.", "750": "However, the first zero price bids German offshore wind auctions in 2017 and subsequent auctions prompted governments to introduce non price criteria to be able to distinguish between bids.", "751": "Since then, growing supply chain, cyber security and sustainability concerns, and policies to expand local manufacturing, have led policymakers in an increasing number of countries to introduce non price criteria .", "752": "Introducing non price criteria into auctions allows governments to pursue multiple policy objectives beyond cost minimisation, such as renewable energy integration, supply chain diversification, local economic development and the sustainability of imported or domestically manufactured equipment used in renewable energy projects.", "753": "Benefits for local communities are another potential priority that can increase public acceptance of renewable energy projects, reducing impediments to their deployment.", "754": "Nevertheless, introducing non price criteria could result in higher awarded prices , puts less emphasis on awarding the lowest cost projects, and increases developers\u2019 administrative costs for compliance.", "755": "Plus, challenges during project planning and development could increase, requiring additional legal action and monitoring to ensure that all bidders are treated fairly and comply with project requirements.", "756": "In the first half of 2024, 49 GW of renewable capacity was awarded using non price criteria, almost already achieving last year\u2019s total capacity.", "757": "This corresponds to around 60% of all awarded capacity.", "758": "In fact, the share of capacity auctioned with non price criteria among all competitive auctions worldwide has more than doubled since 2021.", "759": "More than 15 countries have used them at least once in their auctions, and in the first half of 2024, seven countries applied non price criteria.", "760": "India accounts for 66% of this global awarded capacity.", "761": "More than half of the remaining 17 GW stems from European auctions, namely in the Netherlands, France and Norway, while the United States awarded more than 4 GW in auctions with non price criteria.", "762": "In 2024, non price criteria have been used mostly in auctions for utility scale solar PV  and offshore wind .", "763": "For solar PV auctions, the foremost impetus for using non price criteria has been India\u2019s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers  policy, which was reinstated in 2024.", "764": "The ALMM scheme allows developers to use only modules on the list for government related PV projects.", "765": "Today, only companies manufacturing in India are included.", "766": "In 2024, the average price of modules manufactured in India has been 40% above imported Chinese module prices, including a 40% import tax.", "767": "An expected increase in the cost of sourcing modules is one of the factors that led to the stabilisation of PV auction tariffs in India between 2023 and 2024, even though global module prices fell more than 60% in this period.", "768": "Ensuring a sufficient supply of high quality domestic modules by carefully balancing industrial and trade policies will be crucial for the success of future PV auctions and the timely deployment of contracted projects.", "769": "The offshore wind sector is more regionally balanced, since European countries , Asia Pacific ones , and the United States have applied non price criteria in their auctions.", "770": "For instance, the Netherlands takes the wind farm\u2019s contribution to the Dutch North Sea ecosystem into consideration in the selection process.", "771": "However, France has been the main country to apply non price criteria in onshore wind auctions, awarding almost all the relevant capacity.", "772": "Non price criteria can be implemented as either prequalification or award conditions.", "773": "Prequalification criteria are minimum requirements that set a threshold or standard that bidders must comply with to participate in the auction.", "774": "The subsequent selection of a winner is conducted purely on the basis of price.", "775": "Today, prequalification criteria are applied mostly in solar PV auctions, accounting for 76% of capacity awarded under non price criteria in 2023 and 95% in the first half of 2024, mainly owing to India\u2019s ALMM requirement.", "776": "Since prequalification criteria are compliance requirements, governments have a high likelihood of achieving their policy objectives.", "777": "Nevertheless, if the criteria or thresholds are too strict, the auction might be undersubscribed.", "778": "In contrast, award criteria are applied during the selection of winning bids, thereby rewarding higher performance in specific project characteristics .", "779": "Award criteria have become increasingly prevalent in wind energy auctions across Europe.", "780": "In 2023 and 2024, for those onshore wind auctions that used non price criteria, award criteria were applied to choose nearly all awarded capacity, largely due to French auctions.", "781": "Offshore wind auctions show a more balanced approach, but still favour award criteria.", "782": "In 2023, 78% of offshore auctions with non price elements used award criteria, slightly higher than the 67% in 2024.", "783": "Major European offshore markets such as the Netherlands, Germany and France have adopted this approach.", "784": "This trend even extends beyond Europe, with countries such as Japan, the United States and Korea also incorporating award criteria into their offshore wind auctions.", "785": "Award criteria present more of a trade off between the bid price and project characteristics compared with prequalification criteria.", "786": "The auctioneer needs to give a weighting to project characteristics along with the bid price and design a scoring scale.", "787": "The higher the weighting of non price variables, the more important a criterion becomes in the selection process.", "788": "For instance, giving considerable weight to the sustainability of equipment manufacturing could enable a project with a higher bid price  to still be awarded, as it is able to deliver the pursued policy objective.", "789": "For instance, two bidders are competing in an auction with projects using PV modules from Country A and Country B.", "790": "The submitted bid prices and the non price criterion are converted into a score with a maximum of 100 points, and the project receiving more points  is selected.", "791": "The weighting defines the maximum points that can be received for the non price criterion: for instance, a weighting of 30% for non price criterion means that 30 points can be achieved, while 70 points  can be gained for the price criterion.", "792": "In this case, the solar PV project with PV modules made in Country A submits a bid price of EUR 66/MWh and does not receive points for the non price criterion due to, for instance, inadequate sustainability or supply chain security.", "793": "In contrast, the project with Country B made PV modules submits a higher bid price of EUR 72/MWh but receives all the points possible for the non price criterion.", "794": "No non price criterion: the Country A PV module project wins because it has a lower bid price and thus the higher score of 61.", "795": "The weighting of the non price criterion is set to 5%.", "796": "Now, the project with Country A PV modules receives only 58 points for its bid price , while the project with Country B PV modules receives 48 points , 43 for the bid price and 5 for the non price criterion.", "797": "In this case, the project with Country A modules would be selected.", "798": "The weighting of the non price criterion is set to 15%, giving the project with Country B PV modules an advantage.", "799": "It receives 15 points for the non price variables and 39 for the bid price, now overtaking its competitor by 2 points.", "800": "The weighting of the non price criterion is set to 30%.", "801": "The project with Country B PV modules would be selected because it would score 19 points more than its competitor by receiving 30 additional points for the non price criterion.", "802": "The scoring scale needs to allow for project differentiation: if all participating projects achieve all  of the points for a non price criterion, it has no impact on winner selection.", "803": "Moreover, the larger the scale, the less influential are differences among the projects.", "804": "In contrast, the shorter the scoring scale, the stronger the impact of project differences.", "805": "The importance of parametrising award criteria can be observed in Japan\u2019s first offshore wind auction in 2021.", "806": "Although bid price and non price criteria were equally weighted , price was mostly the decisive criterion during winner selection.", "807": "While the lowest submitted bid price automatically received the maximum 120 points, the best performing project in the non price criteria might not receive the full points, as these depend on the evaluation committee\u2019s decision.", "808": "All winning projects received maximum points for the price, while none of the participating projects received more than 98 points in the non price criteria.", "809": "Also exemplifying the importance of parametrisation are France\u2019s solar PV auctions, which assess, among other features, the carbon footprint of installed modules for winner selection .", "810": "The first two auctions resulted in a rather diverse supply of installed modules, with both relatively small and large carbon footprints.", "811": "Since 2023, projects with modules of Chinese origin have been awarded almost exclusively, even though their considerable carbon footprint puts them at a disadvantage for the non price criterion.", "812": "In the current parametrisation of the auctions, a project with Chinese modules is ranked higher if its bid price is EUR 4 8/MWh lower than a project with EU made modules, which scores much higher in the sustainability criterion.", "813": "Using Chinese modules leads to a LCOE, which is roughly EUR 6 8/MWh lower, so most project developers opted for them.", "814": "France\u2019s solar PV auctions , conducted under the current design since late 2021, select winners based on the submitted bid price and three non

particularly, the EU NZIA envisions solar PV manufacturing capacity of at least 30 GW by 2030, while wind manufacturing capacity should reach at least 36 GW.", "821": "According to the main case forecast, these manufacturing targets represent 51% of solar PV and 115% of wind capacity additions in 2030.", "822": "Among other criteria, the NZIA proposes several non price prequalification and award criteria to support demand for EU made modules: \uf09f Resilience, which in contrast to the others needs to be included, should disincentivise component procurement from a third country outside the EU that already supplies more than 50% of the specific technology or its main specific components in the European Union.", "823": "Environmental sustainability going beyond the minimum requirements of current legislation could be implemented through rewarding, for instance, the ease and quality of recycling, the consumption of energy, water and other resources in one or more life cycle stages of the product, or the carbon footprint of the product or its environmental footprint.", "824": "Innovation could incentivise developing and using entirely new approaches or improving already existing solutions.", "825": "Energy system integration could promote investments in system friendly additions to renewable energy projects, such as energy storage as heat, or the production of renewable hydrogen.", "826": "Nonetheless, especially in case of solar PV, these criteria do not necessarily mean that EU made modules will be preferred in auctions.", "827": "Given that modules from other regions tend to be more affordable, and sometimes equally sustainable, both criteria might spur demand for modules from Korea, the ASEAN region, India or the United States.", "828": "They may also incentivise non EU companies to ramp up their manufacturing capacities in the European Union.", "829": "While non price criteria can support demand for locally made modules and turbines, attracting investments for large scale manufacturing of clean energy equipment would require additional support.", "830": "For solar PV, the economic benefits of expanding EU manufacturing should be assessed from a wider perspective, recognising that consumers may face higher costs in the current economic environment.", "831": "Based on our forecast, achieving the 40% EU goal in 2030 would cost an additional EUR 2,2 3,0 billion based on the difference in investment costs compared with using cheaper Chinese solar PV modules.", "832": "Governments can pursue multiple policy objectives by using non price criteria in renewable energy auctions, in addition to minimising public support.", "833": "Nevertheless, some policy objectives may be addressed more adequately and comprehensively through avenues other than auction design , especially, since non price criteria can induce higher transaction costs for both the auctioneer and the bidders.", "834": "However, harmonising non price criteria design across different countries, especially within the European Union, could reduce these transaction costs.", "835": "Moreover, countries should consider a technology specific design approach, as each technology can face specific challenges, for instance a lack of methodology to calculate the carbon footprint of wind turbines.", "836": "Non price criteria should be clear, transparent and quantifiable to increase the legal robustness of auction outcomes.", "837": "In addition, the minimum and maximum scores assigned in award criteria should be defined exogenously by the auctioneer  to avoid strategic bidding behaviour.", "838": "Finally, policymakers should consider communicating a detailed description of the intended non price criteria early in the process to reduce uncertainty.", "839": "This approach would also help developers plan their projects in advance and allow the supply chain to prepare.", "840": "Consultations and feedback loops with the industry and key

year, the manufacturing of the lowest capacity segment, polysilicon, reached 850 GW.", "845": "Another 140 390 GW of new PV manufacturing is expected to be added in 2024.", "846": "Wafers become the segment with the lowest capacity, but it still reaches more than 1 100 GW, more than double global installations that year.", "847": "Global supply chain investments are expected to slow drastically through 2030, especially in China, due to high overcapacity worldwide.", "848": "Increasingly challenging market conditions have led us to revise expected manufacturing capacity for 2030 downwards from last year , by around 5% for modules, 10% for cells, 20% for polysilicon and 25% for wafers.", "849": "Low prices and tight margins led to the cancellation of about 300 GW of polysilicon and 200 GW of wafer projects, with a total value of approximately USD 25 billion.", "850": "Despite the slower pace of growth, wafer manufacturing capacity  is still expected to exceed installations by almost 40%.", "851": "Over 90% of the supply chain expansion boom in 2023 2024 is occurring in China, positioning the country to maintain a market share of 80 90% by 2030, despite significant investment

an accelerated case scenario.", "853": "In India, the Production Linked Incentive , the Approved List of Module Manufacturers, and increased import duties on modules and cells are spurring supply chain investments.", "854": "Module assembly capacity is expected to more than double between 2022 and 2024 to reach 50 GW, with further growth in the following years as projects that won PLI support gradually come online.", "855": "However, delays in development are expected in other segments due to high competitiveness of imports and technological challenges.", "856": "In the United States, the IRA and import restrictions drive growth.", "857": "As a result, module assembly capacity could reach 45 GW in 2024, including over 7 GW of thin film PV technology.", "858": "In the other supply chain segments, growth is expected to be slower, with several projects in wafers, polysilicon and cells delayed or cancelled due to high competitiveness of imports.", "859": "Investment in the European Union remains limited by insufficient policy support and difficulties in competing with established, large scale global manufacturers.", "860": "In fact, several manufacturers have either shut down their EU sites because they could not compete with imports or relocated their operations to the United States to benefit from the IRA.", "861": "Overall, module manufacturing capacity in the region is expected to increase only 5 GW in 2024 2030, remaining below 20 GW.", "862": "In the Asia Pacific region, excluding India, module assembly capacity is expected to decline by about 25 GW  as Chinese manufacturers respond to changing trade regulations in United States, the region\u2019s main export market.", "863": "Over 10 GW of wafer manufacturing is under development in Viet Nam, which will increase the region\u2019s capacity in this segment to over 40 GW in 2024, the second highest after China.", "864": "The main factor influencing PV manufacturing is a step increase in overcapacity across the entire supply chain, which materialised fully in 2024.", "865": "Demand for PV modules is not expected to catch up with supply, resulting in a drop in average utilisation rates from about 55 80% in 2023 to 50 65% in 2024.", "866": "PV module distributors, developers and other demand side market participants continued to increase their inventory in the first half of 2024, so that manufacturer utilisation rates reflected more than just demand resulting from annual PV system installations.", "867": "If the recent import trend continues, PV module inventories might reach the triple of installations expected in 2024 in the European Union, and double those of the United States by the end of 2024.", "868": "In the absence of PV equipment stockpiling, average PV manufacturer utilisation rates in 2024 would decrease to 40 50%.", "869": "Extra demand for new modules is expected to fall in upcoming years as distributors draw from their inventory to limit storage costs.", "870": "The current supply glut is reducing PV module prices as producers compete for market shares.", "871": "Between December 2022 and 2023, the average spot price of solar PV modules decreased 50% and continued to decline in 2024, falling to roughly USD 0,10/W in July 2024.", "872": "Current prices are below production costs for most companies, adversely affecting their financial situation.", "873": "This is especially challenging for smaller, less efficient firms that do not use the latest technologies.", "874": "Considering the main case PV installation forecast, average utilisation of supply chain segments is expected to stay below 60% for modules and cells, slightly surpass this level for polysilicon, and reach 80% for wafers through 2030, continuing to exert downward pressure on PV module prices.", "875": "At the same time, our expectations have increased regarding shutdowns of existing capacity.", "876": "This includes the decommissioning of production lines that are less efficient or are used to manufacture less technologically advanced", "877": "At the end of 2023, about 15% of global manufacturing capacity for polysilicon and 10% for wafers could be considered at risk because it was at least five years old and potentially using suboptimal production processes.", "878": "However, company announcements indicate that closures of plants in these two supply segments are expected to accelerate the most due to their greater technical challenges and high costs to upgrade production lines to the latest standards.", "879": "For cells, about half of manufacturing capacity worldwide uses PERC technology that is quickly being replaced by TOPCon, heterojunction  and back contact , due to their higher efficiency.", "880": "The market has been dominated by PERC cells since 2020, when their market share reached over 80%.", "881": "Currently, manufacturers are investing heavily in retooling their plants and switching mostly to TOPCon, which is expected to obtain a market share of over 70% in 2024.", "882": "Recent investments in the latest technologies aim to maintain competitiveness in an oversupplied market and to force many financially vulnerable manufacturers to terminate their operations.", "883": "In this case, however, an influx of new projects and plant expansions is offsetting expected capacity losses.", "884": "About 25% of existing module assembly capacity is at minor risk, as it cannot utilise cell sizes of the latest standard.", "885": "However, most manufacturers will likely be able to adjust their plants, limiting expected shutdowns.", "886": "However, the amount of technologically substandard capacity owned by lower tier companies is relatively small, limiting the short term risk of a significant drop in PV component supplies.", "887": "In 2023, the top ten companies in terms of overall capacity across the supply chain controlled over 45 60% of the market.", "888": "If the largest remaining companies in each segment are added, the market share of top manufacturers reaches 85% for polysilicon and wafers, 70% for cells and 60% for modules.", "889": "Many of these companies

onshore wind manufacturing projects under development are also planned in China.", "898": "Fierce competition in the domestic market, the introduction of larger turbines requiring new manufacturing plants and increasing interest in export prospects are the main catalysts for Chinese investments.", "899": "In other markets, investments in onshore wind manufacturing remain limited, apart from about 4 GW of capacity throughout the supply chain expected in the United States, driven by IRA incentives.", "900": "Still, manufacturing capacity in the country is expected to remain below the annual demand expected in 2030, especially for blades.", "901": "In Europe, the current 20 25 GW of capacity is significantly exceeding current installations, however it will not be sufficient to cover expected demand starting from 2026 2027, with additional investments required in the nacelle segment especially.", "902": "India and Latin America are expected to maintain their surplus of

first half of 2024.", "918": "Because Chinese turbines do not have a long track record in markets outside of China, Chinese companies are finding it difficult to secure financing to participate in foreign markets.", "919": "However, as turbine price differences between Chinese and European/US OEMs increase and manufacturing overcapacity in China grows, more Chinese OEMs may increase their efforts to secure overseas sales.", "920": "In fact, in July 2024 a Chinese OEM was selected for the first time as the preferred turbine supplier for an offshore wind project in Germany.", "921":

equity gains of 30 70%, surpassing broader energy sector performance.", "927": "The renewable energy sector quickly rebounded following the initial pandemic period, supported by strong demand and solid order backlogs, especially for major wind and solar manufacturing companies.", "928": "This recovery allowed them to maintain profitability while traditional utilities were suffering from revenue losses and slower economic recovery, keeping their market values below pre pandemic levels.", "929": "However, the landscape shifted again with rising commodity prices in 2021, compounded by supply chain disruptions and the energy crisis triggered by Russia's war on Ukraine in 2022.", "930": "These challenges led to increased manufacturing costs for solar PV modules and wind turbines,

technologies, including thin film.", "948": "In the polysilicon industry, the global price of polysilicon had dropped to as low as USD 4 5/kg by Q2 2024 because production capacity worldwide had doubled, reaching 800 GW in 2023.", "949": "This sharp decline followed a period in November 2022 when rising demand for solar PV modules and inadequate polysilicon manufacturing capacity had driven prices up to USD 40/kg.", "950": "During this peak, manufacturers and producers benefited from higher net margins as their costs did not rise proportionally.", "951": "However, the rapid increase in

"1067": "There are several reasons for growing curtailment in Chile.", "1068": "First, the transmission grid is not expanding at the same pace as variable power capacity, which is limiting the flow of energy between the renewable power plants in the north and the demand sources in the centre of the country.", "1069": "Second, the amount of energy on offer is exceeding demand in an increasing number of instances, especially around midday when solar PV generation peaks.", "1070": "The country plans to address this situation by building more transmission capacity and using storage to increase system flexibility.", "1071": "In 2023, the United Kingdom generated nearly one third of its electricity from wind, using both onshore wind systems  and offshore wind.", "1072": "However, as most

invested in transmission infrastructure upgrades in recent years, particularly in its northwestern and southwestern regions.", "1083": "Spain has one of the highest VRE shares, with almost 40% of its electricity coming from wind and solar PV in 2023.", "1084": "Overall, renewables accounted for more than 50% of the country\u2019s electricity generation last year.", "1085": "Despite this high level of renewable penetration, Spain has managed to keep technical curtailment relatively low compared with other markets, although it has been increasing since 2022.", "1086": "Since Spain developed VRE capacity, wind has been the most curtailed renewable energy source, with volumes remaining relatively stable through the years, while solar PV curtailment has recently been increasing quickly with fast expansion of this technology.", "1087": "Around 60% of the VRE curtailed in 2023 was wind.", "1088": "This resource is typically more geographically concentrated and tends to face more congestion at connection points than solar PV, which is generally more evenly dispersed across the nation\u2019s territory.", "1089": "However, monthly profiles show that solar PV curtailment increases significantly in the summer months, surpassing that of wind.", "1090": "Overall, keeping technical curtailment at these rates has been possible thanks to high granularity in observability  and controllability  of units across the power system by the TSO, as well as strong forecast and real time data.", "1091": "In 2022, Spain\u2019s TSO introduced an automatic power reduction system  that automatically sends signals to units when it detects constraints in the transmission grid, so that curtailment happens only if an incident takes places and not preventively, as in the classical approach.", "1092": "Participation in this system has been increasing since its launch, and it covered around 50 GW in mid 2024.", "1093": "In several markets, regardless of their technical

auctions since late 2023, with more rounds expected from these countries as well as planned ones in Portugal, France and Spain.", "1113": "Capacity is also expected to be driven by demand from steelmakers and oil refineries who have announced goals to either produce or procure renewable hydrogen through tenders.", "1114": "Despite this growth, installed electrolyser capacity is expected to fall short of the EU\u2019s 40 GW target due to insufficient demand for renewable hydrogen and regulatory uncertainty in transposing EU mandates.", "1115": "Finding offtakers to achieve financial close is a key forecast uncertainty because of the large cost differential with hydrogen produced from fossil fuels.", "1116": "Some countries are introducing financial support to help industries bridge the cost gap.", "1117": "For example Germany allocated EUR4 billion to its first round of carbon contracts for difference to support energy intensive industries to switch to low emissions

in the transport sector overall.", "1219": "Although aviation and maritime policies are concentrated in advanced economies, Brazil, India and China have proposed blending programmes.", "1220": "Commercial biofuel technologies make up nearly all existing biofuel production capacity over the forecast period.", "1221": "Demand for biogases increases across all sectors , helping governments meet transport, building and industry targets.", "1222": "Most growth occurs in Europe and the United States thanks to established biogas production and support infrastructure, policies and experience.", "1223": "Biomethane, a purified biogas interchangeable with natural gas, is increasingly being used to meet transport obligations in the United States  and in Europe, where biomethane producers sometimes benefit from advanced fuel certificates for renewable fuel quotas.", "1224": "Another major attraction in all regions is the option of injecting biogas directly into natural gas grids to provide energy to any building or industry connected to the grid.", "1225": "Both China and India also have ambitious expansion plans that involve using biogas not only for household and community level digesters, but for transportation fuel and for direct injection into the pipeline system.", "1226": "Despite bioenergy\u2019s dominant role in renewable fuel growth, feedstock supply,

be already approaching sustainable supply limits by 2030.", "1228": "For biogas, growth depends on India and China expanding their feedstock supply chains in the agriculture, livestock and city waste sectors.", "1229": "In the realm of sustainability, measures to ensure that bioenergy use reduces GHG emissions  and mitigates other impacts", "1230": "are not being applied in all jurisdictions with support policies , and are inconsistent across regions that do apply them.", "1231": "Concerning innovation, new technology and process deployment has also been slow, limiting access to more readily available woody biomass supplies.", "1232": "While bioenergy use expands across many sectors and countries, demand for hydrogen  and e fuel  remains limited to the few countries that have policies in place.", "1233": "E fuel growth is restricted to the European Union, which mandates the use of 1,2%  renewable fuels of non biological origin  in aviation by 2030, and 1% in road transport.", "1234": "Meanwhile, hydrogen demand expands primarily in Europe , China  and the United States .", "1235": "Renewable fuels remain more expensive than their fossil counterparts.", "1236": "Bioenergy is generally the most competitive with fossil fuel sources, ranging from near parity for ethanol in some regions to more than twice as expensive for biomethane and biojet fuel.", "1237": "Today\u2019s bioenergy technologies have little scope for cost declines since production costs depend primarily on feedstock prices, which are not anticipated to change significantly over the forecast period.", "1238": "Hydrogen, emerging biofuels and e fuels would require a more than five times premium to average fossil fuel prices.", "1239": "Electrolyser costs have also increased nearly 20% in 2023 due to inflation affecting materials and labour costs, and higher interest rates.", "1240": "However, hydrogen and e fuel production costs could drop almost 30% by 2030, and emerging biofuels by 9%, making the lowest cost options competitive with commercial renewable fuel technologies.", "1241": "These cost declines result from mass production of electrolysers ongoing renewable electricity cost cuts optimisation of hydrogen production and a transition from first of a kind to commercial scale projects from emerging biofuel and e fuel production technologies.", "1242": "In the case of hydrogen, there are also additional infrastructure, storage and equipment costs.", "1243": "Despite the higher cost of renewable fuels, the impact to consumers remains modest at today\u2019s blending rates and 2030 blending targets.", "1244": "For instance, flying from Frankfurt to New York would cost customers an additional 2% with a sustainable aviation fuel  blend rate of 5,3% and e kerosene at 0,7%, if ReFuelEU Aviation targets are met.", "1245": "This level of cost increase is within the monthly variability of jet fuel prices of the last two years.", "1246": "While renewable fuel uptake would need

barriers to renewable fuel uptake.", "1252": "To close the cost gap, widely recognised policies that are used around the world include mandates, financial incentives, performance based standards and carbon pricing.", "1253": "However, the use of demand side policies, especially for hydrogen and e fuels, is lagging.", "1254": "Currently only the European Union and the United Kingdom mandate e

instance, e fuels make up more than 40% of total energy use by 2050.", "1258": "To ensure market competitivity, demand side policies for all renewable fuels should incorporate consistent sustainability requirements and be harmonised internationally, especially in areas for which trade is crucial, such as the international aviation, maritime and hydrogen sectors.", "1259": "While many

40% of solid bioenergy and 20% of biogases are used for electricity generation and over 75% of renewable hydrogen demand is for clean materials, chemicals, and power generation under the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario.", "1265": "Modern solid bioenergy consumption is projected to increase by about one fifth  reaching 18 EJ by 2030.", "1266": "More than 70% of the growth comes from the industry sector, reflecting mostly expanding sugar and ethanol production in India.", "1267": "The remaining growth results primarily from substituting traditional uses of biomass with improved biomass cooking and heating stoves in sub Saharan Africa, India and China, and, to a lesser extent, from the rollout of modern biomass stoves and boilers in Europe.", "1268": "Overall, efficiency gains from modernising biomass use in developing and emerging economies allow total annual solid bioenergy consumption to decline by 5% globally over the outlook period.", "1269": "In 2023, solid bioenergy was the most used modern renewable fuel globally, accounting for 3,5%  of total final energy consumption.", "1270": "Another 19 EJ corresponds to inefficient  uses of biomass, for cooking and heating.", "1271": "These traditional uses of biomass are widespread in the developing world, with sub Saharan Africa, India and China accounting for three quarters of the total.", "1272": "Excluding these, the direct use of modern solid bioenergy is dedicated predominantly to industrial process heat, then to space and water heating in buildings, district heating and, marginally, to agriculture.", "1273": "In the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, modern solid bioenergy consumption expands 2,4 times more quickly than in our outlook, owing to greater reliance on biomass residues and municipal solid waste in industry, especially the cement sector, and to faster substitution of traditional uses of biomass.", "1274": "Modern solid bioenergy use in the buildings sector expands 0,7 EJ during the outlook period, a 16% increase from 2023.", "1275": "Three quarters of this growth occurs in sub Saharan Africa and India following efforts to provide modern energy access.", "1276": "For instance, with the ambition to achieve universal access by 2028, Kenya launched its National Cooking Transition Strategy in 2024, in which improved biomass cookstoves are seen as a relevant

"1281": "The United States accounted for almost half of the expansion during 2017 2023, especially the Northeastern States, where the cost of wood and pellets , the main secondary heating fuels , is competitive with natural gas and electricity.", "1282": "The remainder resulted mostly from rising wood and pellet appliance use in Europe and the deployment of improved biomass stoves , especially in sub Saharan Africa, where strong population growth is also driving up heat demand.", "1283": "European biomass markets are expected to benefit from several recent policy updates in upcoming years.", "1284": "In addition to the RED III updated renewable energy targets, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive  includes various favourable targets and measures, including a gradual phaseout of fossil fuel fired boilers through the lifting of subsidies by 2025.", "1285": "In addition, the new ETS2, created as part of the 2023 revision of the EU Emissions Trading System  Directive and operational from 2027, is expected to favour bioenergy use in buildings and non energy intensive industries.", "1286": "However, uncertainty remains about the impacts of the revised Regulation on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry  on forestry harvests, and hence on residues available for pellet production.", "1287": "Europe is the largest residential and commercial consumer of modern solid bioenergy, accounting for more than half of global buildings sector consumption.", "1288": "Logs and wood chips make up most of the solid bioenergy consumed in buildings, but the use of wood pellets for heating has been growing rapidly in the past decade, especially in the residential sector.", "1289": "The European Union is the world\u2019s foremost pellet market, accounting for 44% of production and 50% of consumption in 2023 mainly for residential use.", "1290": "After two decades of continuous market expansion for pellets and two years of record sales for pellet based appliances, global pellet production stalled in 2023 and the market for pellet appliances is facing headwinds.", "1291": "The EU embargo on forestry products from Belarus and Russia, enforced in 2022, and the consumer rush to stock up on pellets during the energy crisis, led to supply shortages in the European Union and a sharp rise in pellet prices in 2022, which affected consumer confidence and choices through 2023.", "1292": "Furthermore, several key markets experienced policy changes, such as France, where subsidies for pellet stoves were reduced, and Italy, where the government reduced the \u201csuperbonus\u201d tax credit from 110% to 90% and halted the credit trading scheme due to concerns about its impact on public finances.", "1293": "Reduced construction activity and a particularly mild winter  also contributed to fewer heating appliance sales, while consumer aversion to big ticket purchases amid higher interest rates and inflation led households to postpone large investments and retrofit projects or opt for cheaper alternatives.", "1294": "As a result, sales of residential pellet appliances declined sharply , by more than half , in Europe in 2023, while those of wood log stoves increased.", "1295": "Poland was a notable exception, with steady sales of pellet stoves and boilers, thanks to attractive investment support for replacing old coal boilers, especially under the Clean Air Programme.", "1296": "In contrast with the residential segment, sales of large scale appliances  were less affected by pellet price volatility and remained strong throughout the year.", "1297": "However, the downward market trend in residential appliances was temporary.", "1298": "Increased pellet production in some European countries  and additional imports from the United States, Viet Nam and Brazil compensated for lost imports from Russia and Belarus, while pellet demand declined slightly because of mild winter conditions and lower consumption in the commercial heat and power sector.", "1299": "As a result, pellet prices declined during the first half of 2023 and residential appliance markets have since mostly recovered.", "1300": "Yet, pellet prices have not recovered their pre 2022 levels, as production costs continue to be impacted by higher electricity prices.", "1301": "Modern bioenergy consumption rises 17%  to 13 EJ in 2030.", "1302": "India accounts for 60% of this increase, primarily due to expansion of its sugar and ethanol industry, which uses biomass residues  for heat.", "1303": "In 2021, India introduced a Biomass Programme to support briquette manufacturing, providing nearly USD 11 000/metric tonne per hour of manufacturing capacity supporting bioenergy use in other industries.", "1304": "The same year, the country also issued an ambitious co firing mandate for thermal power plants it is expected to come into force progressively before 2026, potentially also stimulating the local pellet industry.", "1305": "The next largest increases were in the European Union, owing mainly to greater use of municipal waste in the cement industry, and of biomass in non energy intensive subsectors.", "1306": "Growth in other regions remains limited to small expansions in industries that already use modern bioenergy, such as the pulp and paper industry.", "1307": "While solid bioenergy is well suited to meet heat demand at the temperature and pressure required by a variety of industrial processes, upside potential varies significantly by sector.", "1308": "For instance, the pulp and paper industry already exploits biomass resources extensively for energy production, while untapped potential to use municipal solid waste in the cement industry is substantial.", "1309": "In other sectors that do not produce biomass wastes and residues onsite, however, scaling up bioenergy use is more challenging, as it requires establishing biomass fuel supply chains and ensuring that fuel characteristics and homogeneity are compatible with existing equipment and processes.", "1310": "Solid bioenergy is also the largest renewable fuel used in district heating, mainly in the form of municipal solid waste and biomass used for cogeneration.", "1311": "Bioenergy use in district heating is anticipated to expand nearly one third by 2030, with developments essentially in the European Union, where the RED III supports adoption through binding targets to increase the share of renewables.", "1312": "The portion of solid bioenergy in the district heat supply is already the highest in this region, over 30% in 2023, with countries such as Denmark, Estonia, Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, Austria and Finland exceeding 50%.", "1313": "In Europe, following three years of consecutive growth, heat generation from municipal solid waste declined 4% year on year in 2022.", "1314": "While part of this decline came from lower consumption  during the economic slowdown, more structural trends such as improved waste sorting and the development of recycling and composting, supported by the proposed revised European Waste Framework Directive, are expected to reduce the availability of waste for energy production in upcoming years.", "1315": "The share of biofuels in total liquid fuel transport demand expands from 5,6% in 2023 to 6,4% in 2030  to reach 215 billion litres a year  by 2030 in the main case.", "1316": "This growth is concentrated in the United States, Europe, Brazil, Indonesia and India, which together account for 85%.", "1317": "These regions are not only maintaining but, in many cases, strengthening their mandates, GHG intensity targets and financial incentives to support biofuel adoption.", "1318": "Globally, road biofuel demand expands by 27 billion litres  and aviation and maritime fuel use increases nearly 9 billion litres .", "1319": "In the accelerated case, biofuel demand expands an additional 70% to reach 275 billion litres  by 2030.", "1320": "This accelerated growth results largely from the United States implementing more stringent longer term policies , India and Indonesia addressing challenges to meet planned policy aims , China implementing its modest road, aviation and maritime targets  and the International Maritime Organization  establishing medium term measures to meet 2030 maritime fuel blending goals .", "1321": "In the main case, regional biofuel growth diverges along sectoral lines.", "1322": "In the road segment, Brazil, India and Indonesia account for most new demand as mandates become stricter and demand rises.", "1323": "In these regions, transport fuel demand increases due to economic activity and relatively slower electric vehicle adoption.", "1324": "These countries are expected to add near 27 billion litres , bringing global road biofuel demand to 205 billion litres .", "1325": "In contrast, there is little growth in aviation and maritime biofuel consumption in the main case, although plans are under way to support these sectors in all three countries.", "1326": "In the United States and Europe, aviation and maritime biofuels make up almost all new growth, propelled by new mandates and incentives.", "1327": "Biojet fuel demand climbs to nearly 9 billion litres , accounting for 2,0% of global aviation fuel demand, while maritime biofuels account for 0,8% of international shipping.", "1328": "However, in the road sector, combined US and EU biofuel demand does not expand to 2030.", "1329": "While transport policies remain in place in both regions , and in the European Union become more stringent , electric vehicles and greater vehicle efficiency reduce transport energy demand.", "1330": "EV use can also count towards meeting EU transport targets and US state level low carbon fuel standards.", "1331": "By 2030, aviation and shipping are responsible for more than 75% of new biofuel demand.", "1332": "Average annual consumption in these sectors expands 30% between 2023 and 2030 to meet targets in North America, Europe and Japan.", "1333": "Overall aviation and maritime fuel demand also increases to 2030, further supporting growth.", "1334": "Conversely, annual demand growth for road biofuels slows considerably by 2030, dropping to just 0,3%.", "1335": "While governments continue to enforce biofuel mandates, incentives and GHG intensity standards over the forecast period, overall global road transport fuel demand is expected to peak in 2028, with earlier peaks in the United States and Europe, thereby limiting growth.", "1336": "Even in fast growing markets such as India, Indonesia and Brazil, total transport fuel demand growth slows considerably by 2030 .", "1337": "Fuel demand declines globally owing to a combination of electric vehicle adoption and vehicle efficiency improvements.", "1338": "By 2030, demand for residue oils , including used cooking oil, tallow, and palm oil mill effluent , climbs 70% to reach 30 Mt/yr, claiming nearly 80% of the estimated supply potential.", "1339": "Producers of biojet fuel, biodiesel and renewable diesel are all vying for this finite supply, as these oils can be used to produce low carbon intensity biofuels while complying with EU and UK feedstock criteria.", "1340": "Rising demand is driving an expansion in trade, as importing residue oils or fuels made from them is more affordable than expanding domestic collection.", "1341": "This trade growth has led to increasing scrutiny to ensure that supplies are genuine, and to greater competition with domestic producers of other feedstocks such as vegetable oils.", "1342": "In the short term, alternative pathways such as vegetable oil based production and the use of other technologies  offer little relief.", "1343": "Most vegetable oils are considered as food and feed crops under the EU RED III and the ReFuelEU Aviation and Maritime initiatives, rendering them either ineligible or restricted.", "1344": "Furthermore, the GHG intensities of many of these biofuel production options are higher than for residue oil use, reducing their effectiveness under GHG intensity regulations.", "1345": "Biofuel facilities that use new technologies are planned, but few will be producing biofuels in the near term.", "1346": "In the medium term, however, new low emissions feedstock pathways appear more promising.", "1347": "Both the European Union and the United States have introduced policies that support innovative agricultural practices, such as growing crops on marginal land and intercropping, as outlined in the RED III.", "1348": "The United States has also issued guidance on climate smart agriculture to help encourage lower emission farming in support of IRA credits.", "1349": "Additionally, several new cellulosic ethanol and Fischer Tropsch  renewable diesel projects are to be commissioned by 2030.", "1350": "These projects would expand biofuel production from emerging technologies nearly tenfold.", "1351": "In our main case, biofuel use in the road, aviation and maritime sectors falls short of the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario trajectory by 1,6 to 14 times, depending on the segment.", "1352": "The maritime sector is furthest off track, primarily due to the lack of substantial new demand drivers beyond the European Union\u2019s ReFuelEU Maritime legislation.", "1353": "Should envisioned policies be implemented globally and planned projects completed, this gap could be considerably smaller in our accelerated case, particularly for the road and aviation sectors.", "1354": "Nonetheless, a 40% shortfall remains compared to the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario.", "1355": "To bridge this gap, it will be crucial to implement supply and demand policies aligned with the Net Zero by 2050 Scenario, incorporating mandates, incentives and GHG intensity requirements.", "1356": "The aviation and maritime sectors require the most attention, as policies are only just beginning to be rolled out, and global co ordination is essential given the international nature of maritime and aviation fuels.", "1357": "Moreover, achieving Net Zero by 2050 Scenario growth will hinge on the deployment of new technologies and innovative agricultural practices.", "1358": "Thus, sustainability requirements and support for emerging technologies and new farming methods are necessary complements to these new policies.", "1359": "Road biofuel demand is forecast to climb 27 billion litres , reaching 205 billion litres  by 2030.", "1360": "Most of this growth will occur in India, Indonesia and Brazil due to growing liquid fuel demand, relatively slow EV uptake and planned increases in biofuel blending requirements.", "1361": "Policy support remains in place in the United States and Europe, but diesel and gasoline use decline 10 to 20% owing to rapid EV adoption and vehicle efficiency improvements.", "1362": "In both markets, renewable diesel consumption expands the most since it can be blended at high concentrations and made from residue oils, and it offers low GHG intensities, which helps countries meet their policy goals.", "1363": "Forecast growth has been revised up 13% from last year.", "1364": "A slightly slower decline in gasoline demand in the United States and Europe drives most of this increase, as greater transport fuel demand requires larger quantities of biofuels to meet blending requirements.", "1365": "In the United States, road biofuel use is forecast to fall 5 billion litres , while blending shares increase.", "1366": "The Renewable Fuel Standard, state level low carbon fuel standards, and tax credits under the IRA continue to support biofuel blending.", "1367": "However, declining gasoline demand owing to EV uptake, vehicle efficiency improvements and limited infrastructure for higher ethanol blends lead to an 8 billion litre  decline in ethanol demand.", "1368": "Biodiesel consumption also drops nearly 3 billion litres  as it is outcompeted by renewable diesel, which has better blending properties.", "1369": "Conversely, renewable diesel use rises 6 billion litres , since it can be blended with diesel at higher rates.", "1370": "Most of this expansion occurs early in the forecast period with the commissioning of planned renewable diesel projects.", "1371": "Achieving quicker growth will require stronger renewable fuel standard targets and strengthened state level low carbon fuel standards.", "1372": "For instance, low carbon fuel standard credits and Renewable Identification Number  prices have dropped 25 to 60% since 2023, reducing incentives for new biofuel production.", "1373": "In Europe, biofuel demand remains flat over the forecast period, despite introduction of the RED III, while blending shares increase.", "1374": "Although the renewable energy target has been raised, we expect only a small increase in biofuel demand because overall transport fuel demand declines 16% over the forecast period and RED III double counting provisions.", "1375": "Under the RED III, biofuels made from certain feedstocks can count twice towards legislated targets, meaning that fewer litres of biofuel are needed to meet the renewable energy target.", "1376": "In addition, renewable electricity used in EVs counts towards the target, limiting biofuel demand.", "1377": "Sweden\u2019s 2023 decision to reduce its transport GHG intensity target by 34 percentage points also slows growth.", "1378": "To date, renewable diesel demand in the country is down nearly 90%, contributing to a 20% decline across Europe.", "1379": "This sudden drop in demand has contributed to increasing biodiesel exports from Europe, and to falling biodiesel and renewable diesel prices.", "1380": "Meanwhile, Brazil\u2019s biofuel demand climbs by over 15 billion litres  to 51 billion litres  in 2030, the largest increase of any country, reaching a biofuel blending rate of almost 45% on a per volume basis.", "1381": "This growth is driven by rising gasoline and diesel demand as well as introduction of its Fuel of the Future Programme, which includes provisions to increase maximum ethanol blending to 35% and biodiesel to 20% by 2030.", "1382": "Brazil also has a large flex fuel vehicle fleet, which allows drivers to choose high or low ethanol blended gasoline depending on the price, allowing for ethanol blends above the mandated amount.", "1383": "In Indonesia, biodiesel blending stands at 34% in 2024, with plans to expand it to 35% by 2030 supported by a funding mechanism that uses palm oil export revenues to close the cost gap with fossil diesel.", "1384": "Similarly, in India the government continues to pursue its ethanol blending target of 20% by 2025/26, supported by guaranteed pricing for ethanol depending on feedstock type.", "1385": "In the accelerated case, road biofuel demand climbs to 255 billion litres  by 2030, up 51 billion litres  from the main case.", "1386": "This additional growth results from more ambitious renewable fuel standard targets in the United States, quicker expansion of higher ethanol blending infrastructure, clear support for renewable diesel in Brazil, more ambitious road targets in the European Union, and policies to achieve Indonesia\u2019s ethanol blending goals and India\u2019s biodiesel blending target.", "1387": "Road biofuel prices have declined and remain below the peaks reached in 2022 when trade disruptions, high energy and fertiliser prices and weather related supply disruptions drove feedstock prices to record highs.", "1388": "By September 2024, ethanol prices had dropped near 25% on average and biodiesel and renewable diesel prices had fallen over 35% from average 2022 prices.", "1389": "Both decreases result primarily from greater feedstock affordability with price declines for sugar , corn  and vegetable oils  between 2022 and the first half of 2024.", "1390": "In addition, oversupply in the biodiesel and renewable diesel sectors, along with an influx of low cost used cooking oil from China, is weighing on prices in 2024.", "1391": "Nevertheless, market prices remain 15% higher for biodiesel and renewable diesel compared with the 2010 2019 average while ethanol prices are near this average.", "1392": "In Europe, inexpensive Chinese imports and lower demand have prompted European producers seeking a more lucrative market to increase biodiesel exports to the United States.", "1393": "In 2023, these imports helped reverse the trend of declining biodiesel use in the United States.", "1394": "However, we do not expect this tendency to continue in 2024, as Chinese exports to Europe have declined with the EU antidumping investigation and its plans to set tariffs on Chinese imports.", "1395": "Over the medium term, we expect biodiesel and renewable diesel prices to remain above historical averages, as the feedstocks they are made from remain in high demand for road, aviation and maritime fuels.", "1396": "Biodiesel and renewable diesel are also commanding ever larger shares of global feedstock production and supply.", "1397": "In contrast, ethanol prices are likely to face less pressure as feedstock production shares remain steady over the forecast period, and ethanol demand declines in some markets.", "1398": "Total road feedstock demand increases 13% to over 700 Mt by 2030, accounting for nearly 90% of global biofuel feedstock demand growth.", "1399": "Vegetable oils and residue oils support most of the expansion for biodiesel and renewable diesel production, with demand concentrated in the United States, Indonesia, Brazil and Europe.", "1400": "Most new ethanol production in Brazil and India rely on starches  and sugars .", "1401": "Demand for other feedstocks such as woody wastes and residues for cellulosic ethanol and FT renewable diesel surpass 2023 levels by more than five times, but they remain a small component  of overall feedstock demand.", "1402": "While domestic availability is the primary determinant of the types of feedstocks used in different regions, sustainability requirements  limit some feedstock use and drive imports.", "1403": "In Brazil and India, which were responsible for 60% of global sugar production in 2023, sugar demand for ethanol production increases by 15% by 2030, from 375 Mt in 2023.", "1404": "Meanwhile, biofuel producer demand for starches, primarily maize, expands 0,5% overall, increasing in Brazil and falling in the United States following forecast changes in domestic production.", "1405": "Vegetable oil demand climbs more than 40% in the main case.", "1406": "Malaysia and Indonesia account for the majority of increasing palm oil demand, while soybean oil and canola oil support most new US growth.", "1407": "In the United States, all feedstock supply chains will be under pressure to produce lower GHG intensity fuels since biofuel producers will be assessing the relative benefits of different production pathways in terms of feedstock prices and the credit benefits of the IRA and state level low carbon fuel standards, which reward better GHG performance.", "1408": "Vegetable oil demand growth in the Europe is limited to crops that meet RED III requirements for production on severely degraded land or intermediate crops that meet specifications.", "1409": "Demand for residue oils, including used cooking oil, tallow, and palm oil mill effluent expands 35% to 22 Mt/yr, primarily in the United States and Europe and in countries exporting to these markets.", "1410": "This surge in demand has prompted an increase in

"These CBG blending obligations for gas marketing companies will stimulate supply considerably.", "1616": "Despite last year\u2019s slow growth, the pipeline for new projects is expanding quickly.", "1617": "At the beginning of October 2024, 871 plants were operational and 357 were completed or under construction in the GODBARdhan registry.", "1618": "Most registered plants are small scale community facilities, but some large and very large plants are also planned.", "1619": "Major biogas companies have begun to invest in India .", "1620": "Main case expected growth for biogas and CBG combined is 8% between 2023 and 2030, including a decrease in production from household facilities.", "1621": "If these small plants are not taken into consideration, however, overall growth would be 88% in the main case and 151% in the accelerated case, reflecting a strong uptick in Indian market activity.", "1622": "Transport is a growing end use sector in India, with compressed natural gas fleet increasing rapidly.", "1623": "The SATAT programme currently supports transport, and CBG is delivered in compressed cylinders or cascades when grid connection is not possible.", "1624": "Transport CBG consumption is expected to grow 4 fold in the main case during 2023 2030, and 6,8 fold in the accelerated case.", "1625": "Hydrogen demand in 2023 was 12 EJ , produced almost exclusively from fossil fuels.", "1626": "Low emissions hydrogen, made from fossil fuels with CCUS, from bioenergy or through electrolysis, makes up less than 1% of global supply.", "1627": "Natural gas with CCUS was the source for most low emissions hydrogen produced in 2024, while electrolytic hydrogen made up less than 0,1%.", "1628": "Hydrogen demand stems primarily from its use as a feedstock for refining and for ammonia and methanol production.", "1629": "In 2023, the use of hydrogen as a renewable fuel or as a component of renewable fuel production, such as for e fuels, was negligible, limited to hydrogen vehicles and demonstration e fuel facilities.", "1630": "Low emissions hydrogen production expands nearly 11 times to 0,8 EJ by 2030, representing 7% of total hydrogen demand today, with near 75% generated from renewable electricity.", "1631": "Of the 0,6 EJ of renewable hydrogen produced, only 0,1 EJ is for direct energy use, primarily in the transport sector, and is considered a renewable fuel in this analysis.", "1632": "Renewable hydrogen is also a key component of e fuel production, which consumes 18% of all renewable hydrogen produced by 2030.", "1633": "The rest serves as a feedstock in the refining sector or is used for biofuel production and to produce clean ammonia as a fertiliser.", "1634": "Additionally, nearly 15% of renewable hydrogen is utilised in the power sector.", "1635": "The use of renewable hydrogen and e fuels for energy  expands to 0,17 EJ by 2030, from near zero today.", "1636": "A few key policies in Europe, the United States and China spur almost all this increase.", "1637": "Most hydrogen and e fuel demand originates from the transport market, with e fuels being claimed for aviation and maritime applications, and hydrogen for heavy duty transport.", "1638": "However, high costs and limited policies encouraging uptake make it difficult to construct a profitable business case, restricting growth prospects for both fuels.", "1639": "Existing policies have not yet catalysed the investments needed to realise ambitions, although sufficient production to match the demand forecast in this publication could be achieved if projects currently at the feasibility stage secure final investment decisions and are constructed by 2030.", "1640": "In Europe renewable hydrogen and e fuel demand expands to 45PJ to meet RED III, ReFuelEU Aviation and UK SAF mandates.", "1641": "These legislative measures set minimum requirements for RFNBOs, which include hydrogen and e fuels.", "1642": "In the European Union, the RED III targets 1% RFNBOs by 2030, which we expect will be met primarily by renewable hydrogen used in refineries or to produce biofuels.", "1643": "In the aviation sector, ReFuelEU Aviation aims for 1,2% by 2030/31 and the UK SAF mandate requires 0,5% RFNBO blending by 2030.", "1644": "The European Union has also set a maritime RFNBO target for 2034, but it falls outside the scope of this forecast.", "1645": "In the United States, total renewable hydrogen and e fuel demand grows to 50 PJ, covering hydrogen for road applications, some e kerosene, and ammonia and methanol for use in the shipping industry.", "1646": "Hydrogen and e fuels both benefit from credits under the IRA and low carbon fuel standards, and e kerosene is also eligible for renewable fuel standard credits.", "1647": "At average 2024 credit prices, renewable hydrogen used in transport would receive USD 11/GJ and e kerosene USD 80/GJ, closing the cost gap with fossil fuels in some instances.", "1648": "In China, demand for hydrogen comes mainly from the road transport sector, particularly to power heavy duty fuel cell vehicles, as the country aims to have 50 000 fuel cell vehicles on its roads.", "1649": "In Europe, the United States and China, maritime sector demand for ammonia and methanol is driven primarily by offtake agreements with international shipping companies that have internal targets.", "1650": "Offtake agreements for ammonia and methanol currently amount to near 40 PJ."}
